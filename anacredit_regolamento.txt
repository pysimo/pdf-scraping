About the second edition of the
AnaCredit Manual
1 The AnaCredit Reporting Manual (the “Manual”) has been updated. The previous
2 version dated back to November 2016.
3 Highlights of this edition
4 The Manual has been updated to acknowledge and incorporate the additional
5 explanations provided in the Q&As published on the ECB’s website between July
6 2017 and December 2018.
7 The updated Manual also incorporates a number of adjustments to address previous
8 inconsistencies. At the same time, the structure has been reorganised and
9 streamlined. Specifically, some explanatory paragraphs have been moved to
10 different parts of the Manual, and cross-references have been added with a view to
11 facilitating consistency and readability. Moreover, references to the implementing
12 technical standards (ITS) on supervisory reporting have been updated throughout
13 the Manual to keep them in line with the amendments to Commission Implementing
14 Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 (the “amended ITS”).
15 Finally, the format and the language style have been aligned throughout the whole
16 text.

1 About the Manual
1.1 Introduction
1 This Manual presents detailed information and guidance concerning AnaCredit
2 reporting requirements as set out in the AnaCredit Regulation1.
3 The Manual explains the methodology underpinning data collection and the data
4 model, and includes guidance on the preferred approach that may be taken in cases
5 where the respective ECB legal act leaves scope for different interpretations.
6 The Manual contains no additional requirements and has no binding legal status, as
7 it merely aims to provide guidance by clarifying and providing examples related to
8 the requirements and definitions previously laid down in the AnaCredit Regulation.
9 The AnaCredit Regulation is the sole legally binding act.
10 The requirements of AnaCredit establish a common granular credit dataset shared
11 among the Eurosystem members (referred to as the AnaCredit database) and
12 comprising input data of all euro area Member States and any other states
13 participating in AnaCredit on a voluntary basis.
14 With a view to creating a common database, it is of the utmost importance that
15 concepts, definitions and reporting practices are aligned across countries to ensure a
16 rigorous methodological background and accurate comparable international
17 information.
1.2 Who should read the Manual
18 The information in the Manual may be of interest to reporting agents, data compilers
19 and users of the AnaCredit database.
20 The Manual also provides essential information for national authorities in charge of
21 collecting the information as a part of a broader national reporting framework, with a
22 view to ensuring consistency between the AnaCredit requirements and any related
23 national extensions thereof.
1.3 Which reporting requirements are covered in this Manual
24 Only the common requirements as The Manual only covers the reporting requirements laid down in the AnaCredit
set out in the Regulation are
25 Regulation.
covered
No national extensions covered
1 Regulation (EU) 2016/867 of the European Central Bank of 18 May 2016 on the collection of
granular credit and credit risk data (ECB/2016/13) (OJ L 144, 1.6.2016, p. 44).
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 5
31 May 2019
1 The Manual does not cover any other reporting requirements; this relates in
2 particular to any additional requirements that are part of a broader national reporting
3 framework and extend the reporting of credit and credit risk data beyond the scope
4 outlined in the AnaCredit Regulation. If relevant, any such additional requirements
5 will be determined and appropriately communicated by national central banks
6 (NCBs).
1.4 Scope of national implementations
7 National extensions With a view to ensuring efficient reporting and adequate interoperability with other
8 existing or new reporting frameworks, NCBs may collect the information to be
9 transmitted to the AnaCredit database as part of a broader national reporting
10 framework. Consequently, NCBs may extend the reporting of granular credit and
11 credit risk data beyond the scope outlined in the AnaCredit Regulation, for their own
12 statutory purposes, in line with relevant national law.
13 Similarly, NCBs decide on the reporting format and timeliness in which they receive
14 the data from reporting agents.
15 In no case does this Manual cover any national extensions of the common reporting
16 requirements, or the format of the reporting or the timeliness with which reporting
17 agents send data to their relevant NCBs.
18 Relevant information on national extensions and the timeliness or format of the
19 reporting is provided by the relevant NCBs.
20 Areas of national discretion In addition to national extensions, there are also requirements set out in the
21 AnaCredit Regulation that are left at NCBs’ discretion.
22 Generally, requirements that are left at NCBs’ discretion are those that may be rolled
23 out differently (or not rolled out at all) in different reporting Member States.
24 Any such requirements are presented and in principle explained in this Manual, i.e.
25 assuming the baseline scenario that reporting agents submit all data attributes listed
26 in Annex I of the AnaCredit Regulation. In other words, for the purpose of the
27 Manual, the requirements are explained as if NCBs had decided not to deviate from
28 the baseline scenario in which all the requirements are required in full. In practice,
29 however, not all of the data attributes may actually be required. The Manual does not
30 provide any information about the actual implementation of such requirements by
31 NCBs.
32 Revision mark: editorial changes Reporting agents and other stakeholders are invited to contact the relevant NCB for

The Manual presents the baseline
29 requirements as laid down in the Unless stated otherwise, the requirements of AnaCredit are discussed assuming the
30 AnaCredit Regulation assuming baseline requirements whereby the relevant NCB does not apply any of the
that neither derogations nor
31 additional requirements apply derogations and reporting agents are required to meet all requirements laid down in
32 the AnaCredit Regulation (and only those requirements).
33 Whether or not NCBs decide to deviate from the baseline requirements, and to what
34 extent, will be communicated by the relevant NCBs.
1.5 Structure of the Manual
35 The Manual is organised into the following parts:
36 Part I explains the general AnaCredit methodology and provides information about
37 the various steps involved in determining the reporting population and the credit
38 instruments subject to reporting and setting up the reporting, including a general
39 description of the underlying data model. It also explains the reduced data
40 requirements as stipulated by Article 7 of the AnaCredit Regulation and the
41 application of derogations for small reporting agents.
42 Part II describes all datasets and data attributes of AnaCredit data collection in detail
43 and provides specific reporting instructions.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 7
31 May 2019
1 Part III presents various case studies and in particular covers special scenarios that
2 require more in-depth explanations.
3 Finally, the Annexes provide additional information relevant for reporting agents such
4 as certain data validation rules.
1.5.1 Part I – general methodology, reporting principles and rules
5 Chapter 1 provides information about the content and intended use of this Manual.
6 Chapter 2 focuses on reporting agents, in particular the scope in terms of the
7 reporting population, and provides a detailed explanation of the entities subject to
8 reporting (reporting agents). The scope in terms of the reference population
9 (observed agents) is then discussed. The reporting obligations of reporting agents
10 are also described, including the meaning of reporting on an individual basis or when
11 there is a change in the population of reporting agents. An explanation of the
12 applicable accounting standard to be used by reporting agents is also provided.
13 Chapter 3 describes counterparties in the context of AnaCredit and provides a
14 definition both of counterparties directly involved in instruments and of counterparties
15 acting as protection providers. A specific section is dedicated to counterparties
16 affiliated with debtors and protection providers.
17 Chapter 4 describes the scope of AnaCredit data collection in terms of instruments
18 covered and focuses on specific issues related to eligible instruments, in particular
19 the activity of observed agents as creditors or servicers, instruments relevant for the
20 creditor, held or serviced instruments, types of counterparties involved and the types
21 of instrument that give rise to credit risk.
22 Chapter 5 explains the different criteria that trigger a reporting obligation with regard
23 to reporting reference dates and the reference period, eligible instruments and
24 debtors’ commitment amounts. The chapter also provides an explanation of when a
25 given instrument is reportable under AnaCredit.
26 Chapter 6 addresses questions related to the concept of credit and the underlying
27 data model. Specifically, credit is conceptually modelled by distinguishing the
28 instrument entity, the protection entity and the counterparty entity. The reportable
29 datasets are then defined on the basis of the conceptual model. Mutual relationships
30 between the reportable datasets are also discussed along with the different methods
31 of reporting data and the reporting frequencies.
32 Chapter 7 discusses the specific statistical reporting requirements related to
33 counterparty and credit data, as set out in Annexes II and III of the AnaCredit
34 Regulation.
35 Finally, Chapter 8 details the circumstances in which derogations and reduced
36 reporting frequency for small reporting agents can be applied.

1.5.2 Part II – datasets and data attributes
1 Part II specifies all the reportable datasets by focusing on the specific data attributes
2 for each reported dataset.
3 In particular, the reporting frequency is discussed for every dataset, and the
4 reporting qualification, definition, applicable values, general reporting instructions
5 and some examples of specific cases are provided for every data attribute.
1.5.3 Part III – case studies
6 Part III analyses specific use cases and examples of particular scenarios. A set of
7 case studies illustrates the issues and challenges encountered. The explanations of
8 how to tackle these issues in the context of AnaCredit reporting help both reporting
9 agents and data analysts to properly reflect the economic substance of the
10 information at hand.
11 Revision mark: editorial changes Part III covers reporting instructions for cases with a given central element, such as
12 securitisations, instruments under a multi-debtor/product structure (credit limit
13 structures), project finance loans, factoring transactions, reverse repurchase
14 agreements and syndicated loans and other multi-creditor instruments. It also
15 provides detailed examples of complete reports.
1.5.4 Annexes
16 Revision mark: this section is The annexes provide additional information relevant for reporting agents, such as
expanded to align with the content
17 lists of country-specific national identifiers and legal forms, as well as examples of

1.6 Q&As
24 Revision mark: this section is The Manual is complemented by further explanations provided via the ongoing Q&A
added to inform about the
25 process.
complementary Q&A process
26 Reporting agents and other stakeholders can submit questions to the relevant NCB
27 at any time. The NCB or, in the case of broader questions, the European System of
28 Central Banks (ESCB), subsequently prepares a response and the NCB concerned
29 communicates this back to the requester – adjusting the response in line with the
30 national reporting framework if applicable. A selection of these Q&As is published on
31 the ECB’s website on an ongoing basis.

1.8 Other relevant information
4 Besides this Manual there is also additional AnaCredit documentation which
5 provides a consistent and comprehensive overview of the reporting requirements
6 from both a methodological and a technical point of view. In addition to the AnaCredit
7 Regulation and the AnaCredit Guideline2, the RIAD Guideline3 provides a description
8 of dataflow frameworks for the enhanced Register of Institutions and Affiliates
9 Database. Finally, in light of Section 1.4 above, available documentation at a
10 national level is also relevant.
11 The AnaCredit Guideline is a legally binding document addressed to NCBs’ that will
12 accompany the AnaCredit Regulation. It details NCBs’ obligations to report credit
13 and credit risk data and reference data to the ECB.
14 Other documents related to AnaCredit within the scope of the Single Data Dictionary
15 (SDD) and the Banks’ Integrated Reporting Dictionary (BIRD)4 also provide
16 information relevant to AnaCredit.
17 The Single Data Dictionary provides the technical specification for the dataset flows
18 between NCBs and the ECB. It only covers the dataflow between NCBs and the
19 ECB, and not the dataflow between reporting agents and NCBs. The latter will be
20 established by the respective NCBs, and reporting agents are advised to consult
21 their NCBs accordingly.

2 Reporting agents and observed agents
1 The first section of this chapter discusses the scope of reporting in terms of entities
2 subject to reporting, which form the reporting population. The second section
3 addresses the scope of reporting in terms of the reference population and provides a
4 detailed description of institutional units and observed agents. Finally, the third
5 section describes the reporting obligations of reporting agents, where the meaning of
6 reporting on an individual basis and the use of special reporting values are
7 explained.
2.1 General concepts
2.1.1 The concept of credit institutions
8 Pursuant to Article 1(18) of the AnaCredit Regulation, credit institution has the same
9 meaning as defined in Article 4(1)(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (hereinafter
10 referred to as “the CRR”)5.
11 Revision mark: editorial changes Article 4(1)(1) of the CRR defines a credit institution as “an undertaking the business
are applied
12 of which is to take deposits or other repayable funds from the public and to grant
13 credits for its own account”. Exemptions laid down in other legal frameworks, such
14 as in Directive 2013/36/EU (hereinafter referred to as “the CRD IV”)6, do not apply.
15 Subsidiaries of credit institutions which meet the above-mentioned definition of a
16 credit institution are credit institutions in their own right.
2.1.2 The concept of institutional units
17 As regards the organisation of AnaCredit reporting, the AnaCredit Regulation uses
18 the concept of an institutional unit.
19 Pursuant to Article 1(3) of the AnaCredit Regulation, “institutional unit” has the same
20 meaning as defined in paragraphs 2.12 and 2.13 of Annex A to Regulation (EU)
5 Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on
prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms and amending Regulation
(EU) No 648/2012 (OJ L 176, 27.6.2013, p. 1).
6 Directive 2013/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on access

1 No 549/2013 (hereinafter referred to as “ESA 2010”)7 – refer to Table 1 for the
2 definition of an institutional unit.
Table 1: Paragraph 2.12 of Annex A to Regulation (EU) No 549/2013
Definition: an institutional unit is an economic entity characterised by decision-making
autonomy in the exercise of its principal function. A resident unit is regarded as
constituting an institutional unit in the economic territory where it has its centre of
predominant economic interest if it has decision-making autonomy and either keeps a
complete set of accounts or is able to compile a complete set of accounts.
To have autonomy of decision in respect of its principal function, an entity must be:
• entitled to own goods and assets in its own right; it will be able to exchange the
ownership of goods and assets in transactions with other institutional units;
• able to take economic decisions and engage in economic activities for which it is
responsible and accountable at law;
• able to incur liabilities on its own behalf, to take on other obligations or further
commitments and to enter into contracts; and
• able to draw up a complete set of accounts, comprised of accounting records
covering all its transactions carried out during the accounting period, as well as a
balance sheet of assets and liabilities.

8 term institutional unit is a central concept of AnaCredit as pursuant to Article 1(10) of
9 the AnaCredit Regulation all counterparties required to be reported to AnaCredit are
10 defined as institutional units.
2.1.3 Institutional units of credit institutions
11 A credit institution consists of one or more institutional units. A distinction is made
12 between the domestic part of a credit institution and its foreign branches.
13 A credit institution always comprises the domestic part of a credit institution.
14 If a credit institution also conducts business in countries other than the country in
15 which it is established, the credit institution also comprises foreign branches.

5 also stipulates that intracompany loans in which an observed agent acts only as
6 servicer are reported (cf. Section 4.6.5.2 for more information).
2.1.3.2 Foreign branches of credit institutions
7 Pursuant to Article 1(4) of the AnaCredit Regulation, a foreign branch is an
8 institutional unit which is a legally dependent part of a legal entity resident in a
9 different country to that where the legal entity is incorporated.

The concept of the domestic part (of a credit institution) versus a foreign branch is
illustrated using the example of a credit institution comprising headquarters located in
Italy and several branch offices in different locations in Italy and Austria.
Headquarters
Branch offices
Foreign branch
Domestic part
In this case, the credit institution consists of two institutional units:
• the headquarters together with all the branch offices in Italy form one institutional
unit (the domestic part of the credit institution);
• the branch offices in Austria form another institutional unit (a foreign branch) in
Austria.

2.2 Reporting Member States, reporting agents and
observed agents in AnaCredit
2.2.1 The distinction between the reporting population and the reference
population
4 AnaCredit distinguishes between the populations of reporting agents (the reporting
5 population) and observed agents (the reference population).
6 The rationale for distinguishing between reporting agents and observed agents is
7 that AnaCredit is designed to collect credit data with a view to obtaining a complete
8 picture of the credit exposures of reporting agents in the reporting Member States,
9 taking into account the area of economic activity of the reporting agent on the one
10 hand, and its credit exposure in a specific country on the other. Subsequently, by
11 linking observed agents with reporting agents, data are collected on loans granted
12 both by resident credit institutions, irrespective of whether they are provided directly
13 by the (domestic parts of the) credit institutions or indirectly via their foreign branches
14 (resident or non-resident in a reporting Member State), and by resident foreign
15 branches of non-resident credit institutions.
2.2.2 Reporting Member States
16 Revision mark: Section 2.2.2 is In line with Article 1(1) of the AnaCredit Regulation, a reporting Member State is:
added covering the definition of
17 “reporting Member State” as laid • a Member State of the European Union whose currency is the euro;
down in the AnaCredit Regulation
18 • a Member State of the European Union whose currency is not the euro that
19 has joined AnaCredit on a voluntary basis.
20 A Member State whose currency is not the euro may decide to become a reporting
21 Member State by incorporating the provisions of the AnaCredit Regulation into its
22 national law or otherwise imposing relevant reporting requirements in accordance
23 with its national law. This may include, in particular, a Member State that participates
24 in the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) via close cooperation in accordance
25 with Article 7 of Council Regulation (EU) No 1024/2013.

2.2.5 Observed agents
7 Pursuant to Article 1(9) of the AnaCredit Regulation, an observed agent is an
8 institutional unit whose activity as creditor or servicer is reported by the reporting
9 agent. The observed agent is either:
10 • the domestic part of the reporting agent, i.e. the institutional unit resident in the
11 same country as the reporting agent of which it forms part; or
12 • a reporting agent’s foreign branch, resident in a reporting Member State; or
13 • a reporting agent’s foreign branch, non-resident in a reporting Member State.

18 A reporting agent may comprise An observed agent is always related to a reporting agent. Depending on the
observed agents located in different
19 reporting agent itself, there may be just one or several observed agents affiliated
countries
20 with the reporting agent. The number of observed agents that a reporting agent has
21 is exactly the same as the number of institutional units of the reporting agent. The
22 former number depends on:
(i) whether the reporting agent is a credit institution or a foreign branch of a
credit institution;
(ii) the number of foreign branches that the credit institution has.
23 Specifically, if the reporting agent is a (resident) foreign branch of a credit institution,
24 the foreign branch is also the (only) observed agent related to this reporting agent.
25 This relationship is a direct consequence of the fact that a foreign branch in a given
26 country forms only one institutional unit.
27 If the reporting agent is a (resident) credit institution, however, the determination of
28 observed agents is twofold.
29 1. If the credit institution comprises only the domestic part, then there is only
30 one observed agent related to this reporting agent (i.e. the domestic part of
31 the credit institution), which coincides with the credit institution. In this case
32 the observed agent is the institutional unit resident in the same country as
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 20
31 May 2019
1 the reporting agent of which it forms part as referred to in point (a) of Article
2 1(9) of the AnaCredit Regulation.
3 2. If the credit institution also has a foreign branch, then the reporting agent
4 comprises two observed agents: the domestic part of the credit institution
5 and the foreign branch. Furthermore, if the credit institution has more than
6 one foreign branch then the number of observed agents related to the
7 reporting agent increases accordingly.
8 A resident foreign branch of a credit institution is:
9 • in the country where the credit institution is located, an observed agent related
10 to the credit institution (where the credit institution is the reporting agent);
11 • in the country where the foreign branch is located, both a reporting agent and
12 an observed agent in its own right.
There are no observed agents
13 which are not affiliated with a Observed agents are always related to a reporting agent. A foreign branch of a credit
14 reporting agent institution may thus be seen as two distinct observed agents depending on the
15 perspective of the reporting agent it is related to:
(i) as an observed agent of the credit institution, on condition that the credit
institution is resident in a reporting Member State, taking the perspective
of the NCB of the reporting Member State in which the credit institution is
located; in this case, the data of the observed agent (i.e. of the foreign
branch) are reported by the credit institution as the reporting agent to the
relevant NCB of the credit institution;
(ii) as an observed agent of the foreign branch itself, taking the perspective of
the NCB of the reporting Member State in which the foreign branch is
located; in this case the foreign branch appears in the dual role of
observed agent and reporting agent which reports the data of the foreign
branch to the NCB where the foreign branch is located.
16 Resident and non-resident Whereas reporting agents are necessarily resident in a reporting Member State, an
observed agents
17 observed agent may be either resident or (applies only in the case of foreign
18 branches) non-resident in a reporting Member State.
19 A foreign branch of a credit institution that is a reporting agent may also be a
20 reporting agent in its own right provided that the foreign branch is resident in a
21 reporting Member State.
22 If a resident credit institution (i.e. a reporting agent in country A) has, for instance,
23 two foreign branches (one in country B and the other in country C), then the credit
24 institution comprises in total three institutional units, all of which are observed agents
25 of the reporting agent:

1 • the domestic part of the credit institution located in country A;
2 • the foreign branch in country B;
3 • the foreign branch in country C.
4 The existence of institutional units (of a credit institution) does not depend on
5 whether or not a credit institution is resident in a reporting Member State. Nor does it
6 depend on whether or not any foreign branch is resident in a reporting Member
7 State.

Chart 4: Observed agent – credit institution with foreign branches and subsidiaries
The concept of the observed agent is illustrated using the example of a credit institution
established in France that has several foreign branches and subsidiaries both within
and outside France.
More specifically, the credit institution has a foreign branch in Italy, a subsidiary in Italy
which conducts banking business, and a foreign branch and subsidiary in country X,
which is not a reporting Member State.

Taking the perspective of the credit institution in France, the credit institution is the
reporting agent that has the following three observed agents:
• the domestic part of the credit institution located in France;
• the foreign branch resident in Italy;
• the foreign branch located in country X.
Neither the subsidiary in Italy nor the subsidiary in country X, nor the subsidiary in
France, are observed agents related to this reporting agent. However, if the subsidiary
in France or the subsidiary in Italy is a credit institution according to Article 1(18) of the
AnaCredit Regulation, then the respective subsidiary is a reporting agent in its own
right.

11 Resident foreign branches of credit institutions report on their own activity as creditor
12 or servicer.
13 Reporting on an individual basis means that loans exchanged between institutional
14 units of a legal entity (for example, between the domestic part and foreign branches)
15 are in principle subject to reporting.
16 Pursuant to Article 3(3), all reporting agents report data to their respective NCB,
17 which is uniquely determined by the country of residence of the reporting agent.
18 Specifically, where a resident credit institution has foreign branches, data concerning
19 all foreign branches of the credit institution are identified individually (separately) –
20 by the counterparty identifier of the institutional unit – and are reported by the
21 reporting agent (which is the credit institution resident in a reporting Member State).

Chart 5: Reporting agent’s obligations – perspective of a resident credit institution
Depending on the particular situation, the reporting agent is the credit institution and/or
the resident foreign branch. A total of three cases arise:
1. The credit institution has no foreign branch – in this case the credit institution is
the reporting agent and reports on its own activity as creditor or servicer (i.e.
the credit institution is the only observed agent). The reporting agent reports
the data of the observed agent to the NCB in the country where the credit
institution is established.
2. The credit institution has a foreign branch resident in a reporting Member State
–in this case the following applies:
(a) The credit institution is a reporting agent and reports on the activity as
creditor or servicer of (i) the one observed agent being the domestic
part of the credit institution and (ii) the other observed agent being the
foreign branch of the credit institution; both sets of data are reported to
the NCB in the country where the credit institution is established.
(b) The resident foreign branch is also a reporting agent and reports on its
own activity as creditor or servicer (i.e. the foreign branch is the
observed agent). The reporting agent reports the data of the observed
agent to the NCB in the Member State where the foreign branch is
located.
3. The credit institution has a foreign branch which is not resident in a reporting
Member State – in this case the credit institution is a reporting agent and
reports on the activity as creditor or servicer of (i) the one observed agent
being the domestic part of the credit institution and (ii) the other observed
agent being the foreign branch of the credit institution; both sets of data are
reported to the NCB in the country where the credit institution is established.
The non-resident foreign branch is not a reporting agent in its own right.
If the reporting agent has both resident and non-resident foreign branches, the data for
the domestic part of the credit institution only need to be reported once (combination of
cases 2 and 3).
Please note that in line with Article 6(4) of the AnaCredit Regulation, the respective
NCB may decide not to collect any data for foreign branches located in countries which
are not a reporting Member State.
This is an overview of a reporting agent’s obligations to report on its observed agents’
activities as creditor or servicer, using the example of a credit institution established in a
reporting Member State.
The flow chart presents the comprehensive reporting obligation of the resident credit
institution and possibly of its foreign branches, depending on the composition of the

The resident foreign branch is a reporting agent. In addition, if the credit institution of
which the foreign branch is a legally dependent part is also resident in a reporting
Member State, the credit institution is also a reporting agent. Two cases arise:
4. The credit institution of which the resident foreign branch is a legally dependent
part is resident in a reporting Member State – in this case the following applies:
a) The resident foreign branch is a reporting agent and reports on its own
activity as creditor or servicer (i.e. the resident foreign branch is also the
observed agent). The reporting agent reports the data of the observed
agent to the NCB in the Member State where the foreign branch is located.
b) The credit institution of which the resident foreign branch is a legally
dependent part is also a reporting agent and reports on the activity as
creditor or servicer of (i) the one observed agent being the domestic part
of the credit institution and (ii) the other observed agent being the foreign
branch; both sets of data are reported to the NCB in the country where the
credit institution is established.
5. The credit institution of which the resident foreign branch is a legally dependent
part is not resident in a reporting Member State – in this case the resident
foreign branch is the reporting agent and reports on its own activity as creditor

or servicer (i.e. the resident foreign branch is also the observed agent). The
reporting agent reports the data of the observed agent to the NCB in the
country where the foreign branch is located. The credit institution of which the
resident foreign branch is a legally dependent part is not a reporting agent.
1 Chart 7 illustrates the reporting obligation of a credit institution with foreign branches
2 and subsidiaries following the concepts of reporting and observed agents (see also
3 Chart 4 above).
Chart 7: Reporting obligations of a credit institution with foreign branches and
subsidiaries
The reporting agent’s obligations are presented using the example of a credit institution
established in one country with foreign branches and subsidiaries in other countries.
Specifically, the credit institution established in France has foreign branches in Italy and
country X (which is not a reporting Member State), and subsidiaries which conduct
banking business in Italy and country X (the subsidiaries are credit institutions according
to Article 1(18) of the AnaCredit Regulation).
Country X

Reporting agent
From the perspective of the Banque de France (BdF), the credit institution is the
reporting agent and reports to the BdF the data relating to its observed agents. The
data are reported separately for each observed agent:
• data for domestic part of the credit institution established in France;
• data for the foreign branch resident in Italy;
• data for the foreign branch located in country X.
With regard to point (3), please note that in line with Article 6(4) of the AnaCredit
Regulation, the BdF may decide not to collect any data for foreign branches located in
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 29
31 May 2019
countries which are not a reporting Member State.
The credit institution does not report data relating to either of the two subsidiaries to the
BdF.
If we consider the credit institution’s situation from the perspective of the Italian national
central bank, the following applies:
• The foreign branch in Italy is a reporting agent in Italy and reports data on its own
activity as creditor or servicer to the Banca d’Italia (BdI).
• The foreign branch in Italy is not a reporting agent for the subsidiary in Italy.
• The foreign branch in Italy is not a reporting agent for any entity outside Italy.
• The subsidiary in Italy is a reporting agent in its own right in Italy and reports data
on its own activity as creditor or servicer to the BdI. In other words the subsidiary
itself – or the domestic part thereof together with the subsidiary’s foreign branches,
if it has any – is its observed agent).
• The subsidiary in Italy is not a reporting agent for the foreign branch in Italy.
• The subsidiary in Italy is not a reporting agent for any entity in country X.
Finally, since country X is not a reporting Member State, neither the subsidiary in
country X nor the foreign branch in country X is a reporting agent.
The credit institution’s reporting obligations are depicted in the flow chart below:

As the subsidiaries in Italy and country X are not observed agents from the perspective
of the BdF, these are not subject to the reporting agent’s reporting obligations. Please
note that if the BdF decides to exercise the provision under Article 6(4) of the AnaCredit
Regulation, the reporting agent may be exempted from reporting data for the foreign
branch in country X (this option is represented by a dotted line).

8 Specifically and according to Annex V of the AnaCredit Regulation, when fulfilling
9 their reporting obligations in the context of AnaCredit reporting, reporting agents
10 satisfy reporting standards that include but are not limited to the following:
(a) reporting to NCBs is timely and within the deadlines set by the relevant
NCB;
(b) statistical reports take their form and format from the technical reporting
requirements set by the relevant NCB;
(c) the technical specifications for data transmission to the relevant NCB are
followed.
11 NCBs also determine whether third parties may submit reports on behalf of reporting
12 agents.
2.3.6 Relevant accounting standards
13 Point 6.2 of Annex I, Template 2, of the AnaCredit Regulation stipulates that the
14 accounting data of an observed agent that are reported to AnaCredit comply with the
15 accounting standard used by the observed agent’s legal entity.
16 Specifically, the accounting standard relevant for any observed agent is the
17 accounting standard used by the credit institution of which the institutional unit (i.e.
18 the observed agent) is part. The accounting standard is relevant for AnaCredit
19 reporting in general and not only in relation to the data attributes in the accounting
20 dataset referred to in Annex I of the AnaCredit Regulation (cf. Section 6 for more
21 information regarding reportable datasets).
22 This means in particular that if the observed agent’s legal entity is subject to
23 Regulation (EU) 2015/534 (ECB/2015/13), the data are reported in accordance with
24 either International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or national generally
25 accepted accounting principles (GAAP) – depending on which standards are applied
26 by the legal entity to report its individual FINREP templates to its supervisor.

2.3.7 Counterparty identifiers to be used in relation to reporting and
observed agents
1 The AnaCredit Regulation requires that both the reporting agent which reports the
2 data and the observed agent whose activity as creditor or servicer is reported be
3 identifiable. For this reason, all the data reported, with the exception of the
4 counterparty reference data, include the identifier of the reporting agent and the
5 observed agent.
6 The identifiers are counterparty identifiers. In the primary reporting (i.e. between
7 reporting agents and the relevant NCB), the identifiers are uniquely assigned at the
8 level of the reporting agent. In the secondary reporting (i.e. between NCBs and the
9 ECB), the identifiers are assigned by the relevant NCB, ensuring that they are
10 uniquely assigned at national level.
11 Whether the same identifiers are used in the primary and secondary reporting
12 depends on national arrangements.

3 Counterparties in AnaCredit
1 This chapter describes counterparties in the context of AnaCredit and provides
2 definitions of both counterparties directly involved in instruments and counterparties
3 acting as protection providers. Furthermore, a specific section is dedicated to
4 counterparties affiliated with debtors and protection providers. More detailed
5 guidance on counterparties is provided in Chapters 6 and 12 of Part II of the Manual,
6 which deal specifically with the counterparty reference data and the counterparty-
7 instrument data (with data on the counterparty role).
3.1 Identification of counterparties relevant in AnaCredit
8 In the context of AnaCredit, counterparty means an institutional unit that is a party to
9 an instrument or to a protection item, or has an affiliation with such a party.
10 All counterparties taking any of the The AnaCredit Regulation stipulates that all counterparties (that are not natural
roles in relation to instruments
11 persons) which take any of the following roles are relevant counterparties and are
should be registered in the
12 counterparty reference data, unless registered in the counterparty reference data:
a counterparty is a natural person
13 • the debtor of the instrument;
14 • the creditor of the instrument;
15 • the servicer of the instrument;
16 • the originator of the instrument, if the instrument is subject to securitisation;
17 • the protection provider that provides protection (if any) to the instrument;
18 • the head office undertaking of (a foreign branch that is) a debtor of the
19 instrument or a protection provider that provides protection to the
20 instrument;
21 • the immediate parent undertaking of any debtor of the instrument, or of any
22 protection provider that provides protection to the instrument;
23 • the ultimate parent undertaking of any debtor of the instrument, or of any
24 protection provider that provides protection to the instrument.

branches (if any)
30 distinguishes between a counterparty which is the domestic part of the legal entity

1 counterparty identifiers because they are different counterparties in the context of
2 AnaCredit. This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 12 of Part II of the Manual,
3 which deals specifically with the counterparty reference data.
4 When identifying counterparties in AnaCredit, the following steps essentially need to
5 be considered:
(a) if reporting an instrument to AnaCredit as at a given reporting reference
date, all counterparties are identified that take any of the following roles:
6 1. debtor of the instrument;
7 2. creditor of the instrument;
8 3. servicer of the instrument;
9 4. originator, if the instrument is subject to securitisation;
(b) if there is a protection item securing the instrument, the protection
provider of the protection item is identified;
(c) once all counterparties taking the role of debtor or the role of protection
provider have been identified, the following information is required:
10 1. the head office undertaking of the counterparty,8
11 2. the immediate parent undertaking of the counterparty (if any);
12 3. the ultimate parent undertaking of the counterparty (if any);
(d) ultimately, all counterparties identified along steps a), b) and c) are
registered in the counterparty reference data as of the given reporting
reference date;
(e) however, the requirement in point 5(d) above is waived for all
counterparties which are natural persons, because data on natural
persons are not collected in AnaCredit.
8 Please note that the head office undertaking identifier should always be registered if the
counterparty is a foreign branch (and is recommended to be registered for a special fund – see
also Section 12.1.1 of Part II of the Manual, which deals specifically with the counterparty
reference data). If the counterparty is the domestic part of a legal entity, the head office
undertaking identifier coincides with the counterparty identifier of the domestic part. Many data
attributes in the counterparty reference dataset refer to the legal entity (e.g. status of legal
proceedings, enterprise size, etc.) and no proper value is thus reported in the counterparty
reference dataset of the institutional unit which is a foreign branch/special fund. As the data
should be available for the legal entity, it is necessary that the record of the foreign branch is
linked with the record of the legal entity via the head office undertaking identifier and a record of
counterparty reference data should be reported for the head office undertaking/the domestic part
of the legal entity.

8 instruments as at a given reporting reference date, each counterparty is only
9 registered in the counterparty reference data once as at that date.9
10 In accordance with these steps, the counterparties are broadly grouped into three
11 categories:
12 A counterparty is directly related to First, considering an instrument that is required to be reported to AnaCredit,
an instrument if the counterparty is
13 counterparties that are directly related to the instrument are identified. These are:
a debtor, creditor, servicer or
14 originator of the instrument (1)the debtor that is obliged to pay to the creditor an amount of money that arises
15 under the instrument; (2) symmetrically, the creditor that has the right to receive a
16 payment that the debtor is obliged to make under the instrument; (3) the servicer that
17 is responsible for the administrative and financial management of the instrument;
18 and (4) the originator that is the transferor of the instrument, and/or bears the credit
19 risk of the instrument, to a securitisation structure, if the instrument is subject to
20 securitisation. There may be more than one of the counterparties thus identified in
21 relation to a single instrument, and all these counterparties which are not natural
22 persons are identified and recorded in the counterparty-instrument dataset along
23 with the roles they take in relation to the instrument.
24 As regards protection items Second, counterparties related to any protection items that secure the instrument
provided by several protection

30 there may be more than one protection provider in relation to any protection item.
31 However, the requirements of AnaCredit are currently such that only one protection
32 provider is reported in relation to protection.10
33 Finally, there are counterparties that are not directly related to the instrument or any
34 protection item securing the instrument but are affiliated with the debtors or the
35 protection providers identified in relation to the instrument. These are: (6) the head

10 For instance, it has been recognised that in the case of financial guarantees provided by several
(joint) guarantors, the AnaCredit data model does not allow all the protection providers to be
recorded. Consequently, the data model is due to be enhanced in the future. Reporting agents
are nevertheless advised to identify all protection providers before the enhancement takes place,
although only one of them can effectively be received in AnaCredit at present. Please refer to

20 counterparty takes on across the related observed agents.

24 each instrument concerned. While there are also other counterparty roles that are
servicer
25 relevant in the context of AnaCredit, only the roles of creditor, servicer and debtor
26 are indispensable for determining the reporting obligation vis-à-vis an instrument.
27 Please refer to Sections 3.2.1.1 and 4.2 for details regarding how the roles of debtor,
28 creditor and servicer link with the reporting criteria for AnaCredit.
29 More detailed guidance regarding the counterparty-instrument dataset is provided in
30 Chapter 6 of Part II of this Manual, which deals specifically with this dataset.
3.2.1 Debtor
31 Article 1(12) of the AnaCredit Regulation defines a debtor as the counterparty which
32 has the unconditional obligation to make repayments arising under the instrument.
33 Consequently, and in line with Annex IV of the AnaCredit Regulation, the debtor is
34 the counterparty that generates the credit risk of an instrument.
There is always a debtor of any
instrument in AnaCredit
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 36
31 May 2019
1 Accordingly, any counterparty which is unconditionally obliged to make payments
2 under an instrument qualifies as a debtor. For example, granting a credit to an
3 institutional unit makes the institutional unit a debtor under the AnaCredit Regulation,
4 because the institutional unit is a counterparty to the instrument.

17 More specifically, a plurality of debtors occurs when two or more counterparties have
18 the unconditional obligation to make repayments arising under the same instrument,
19 irrespective of whether each debtor is (a) fully or (b) partially liable for the instrument.
20 In the context of AnaCredit, debtors are fully or partially liable debtors when they
21 unite, by contract, in making repayment arising under the same contract. Whether a
22 case of fully or partially liable debtors is present depends on the terms in the contract
23 regulating the obligation. More details about how to report the different possibilities
24 are provided in Sections 6.1.3, 6.1.4 and Chapter 7 of Part II of the Manual, which
25 deal specifically with the counterparty-instrument dataset and the joint liabilities
26 dataset respectively.
27 In the case of a plurality of debtors, all the debtors are identified, but only debtors
28 that are not natural persons are actually reported to AnaCredit (cf. Section 6.2.2.2
29 regarding reporting requirements in relation to instruments granted to both legal
30 entities and natural persons and Section 6.1.4 in Part II of the Manual on natural
31 persons).
3.2.1.1 Type of debtor driving AnaCredit reporting
32 Pursuant to Article 4(1)(b) of the AnaCredit Regulation, whether or not an instrument
33 held or serviced by the observed agent is subject to reporting depends on the type of
34 debtor of the instrument. Only those instruments where the debtor is a legal entity or
35 part of a legal entity are subject to AnaCredit reporting.
36 A legal entity is defined in Article 1(5) of the AnaCredit Regulation as any entity
37 which, under the national law to which it is subject, can acquire legal rights and
38 obligations.

13 applies to partnerships and other smaller entity types is discussed in more detail in
14 Chapter 12 in Part II of the Manual, which deals specifically with the counterparty
15 reference data.
3.2.2 Creditor
16 A creditor in the AnaCredit Regulation is the counterparty bearing the credit risk of
17 an instrument other than a protection provider, i.e. the creditor is the counterparty
18 that has the right to receive a payment, irrespective of whether the creditor collects
19 the repayments directly or collection is carried out by a third party, which the debtor
20 is unconditionally obliged to make under the instrument, and irrespective of whether
21 or not the lack of payment is mitigated by any protection.

23 consequence, the creditor and the debtor of an instrument can never be one and the
creditor of an instrument are two
24 different counterparties same counterparty.
25 Generally, creditors lend funds to debtors, which leads to the creation of one of the
26 instruments referred to in Article 1(23) of the AnaCredit Regulation, irrespective of
27 whether the creditor originated the instrument or acquired its economic ownership.11
28 There is always a creditor of any For each instrument reported to AnaCredit, a creditor is explicitly identified and

30 The role of the creditor is illustrated in Example 1, which describes the basic
31 mechanics of traditional securitisations.
11 Counterparties that acquire the economic ownership of an instrument from a third party become
the creditor of the instrument from acquisition even though they have not directly lent funds to
the debtor.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 38
31 May 2019
Example 1: Creditors vis-à-vis traditional securitisation transactions
A traditional securitisation is a transfer of an instrument (or pool of instruments, or part
thereof) to a financial vehicle corporation (FVC), either by the transfer of legal title or
beneficial interest of the instruments from the originator or through sub-participation
where one or more sub-participants agree to fund an instrument in return for the right to
receive the principal and interest repayments for the instrument.
These are securitisations where the transferee acquires the economic ownership of the
instrument, in other words the legal title or the risk and rewards of the transferred
instruments.
In these securitisations, from the moment of the onward transfer, the transferor (i.e. the
original creditor) ceases to be the creditor of the instrument and the transferee (i.e. the
counterparty that acquires the instrument) becomes the new creditor.
When the original creditor only transfers part of the economic ownership of an
instrument, this counterparty remains the creditor to that part of the instrument that it
retains. In addition, because this transaction implies a true sale of the part of the
instrument that has been transferred, the transferee holds a new instrument in the
amount of the transferred part of the original instrument, where the transferee is the
creditor to this new instrument (i.e. the transferee acquires its economic ownership).

3.2.2.1 Observed agent acting as creditor

4 the observed agent is the creditor. All such instruments are considered to give rise to

6 deemed to have the same meaning and are used interchangeably:
7 • instruments held by the observed agent;
8 • instruments in which the observed agent is the creditor;
9 • instruments that give rise to credit risk for the observed agent.
10 Please note that holding an instrument does not imply that the instrument held is an
11 asset of the holder of the instrument – cf. Section 4.4 for more details.

Q&A 2018/0007
21 with the debtor, e.g. collecting principal and interest payments), even if that
22 institution does not have any decision-making power in respect of the instrument
23 being serviced. Consider the following example.
Example 2: “Servicer” responsible for the administrative and financial management
An instrument is originated by a credit institution and then transferred to another
institution. Under the contract between the originating credit institution (the transferor)
and the institution which acquires the instrument (the transferee), the transferee has all
of the decision-making power in respect of the instrument. However, the administrative
processing continues to be performed by the transferor.
Let’s assume that the transferee is a “bad bank” which is not required to report to
AnaCredit. The instrument’s former creditor (i.e. the transferor), which acts as the
servicer of the instrument, is required to report to AnaCredit on the serviced instrument.
The transferor carries out all day-to-day business in respect of the instrument on behalf
of the “bad bank”.
Even though the transferor does not have any decision-making power in respect of the
instrument being serviced, the work that it carries out is included in the definition of
servicing, as explained in Section 6.4.1 in Part II of the Manual. Consequently, it is the
transferor (rather than the new creditor, which is not a reporting agent in the AnaCredit
framework) that is required to report to AnaCredit on the instrument in question.

3.2.4 Originator
1 In the case of instruments registered in the instrument dataset that are subject to
2 securitisation within the meaning of the Regulation (EU) No 1075/2013 (hereinafter
3 referred to as “the FVC Regulation”), the AnaCredit Regulation stipulates that the
4 counterparty acting as the originator of such a securitisation transaction is identified.
5 Pursuant to the FVC Regulation, the originator is the transferor of an instrument or
6 pool of instruments, and/or the credit risk of the instrument or pool of instruments to
7 the securitisation structure.
8 Furthermore, in accordance with the FVC Regulation, a securitisation is a transaction
9 in which an FVC issues financing instruments to investors, and one or more of the
10 following takes place:
(a) an instrument or pool of instruments, or part thereof, is transferred to the
FVC either by the transfer of legal title or beneficial interest of those
instruments from the originator or through sub-participation;
(b) the credit risk of an instrument or pool of instruments, or part thereof, is
transferred through the use of credit derivatives, guarantees or any
similar mechanism to the investors.
11 Whether or not an instrument is subject to securitisation is indicated accordingly in

19 remains the servicer.

3.3 Counterparties acting as protection providers
3.3.1 Protection provider
25 The term protection provider is defined in Article 1(13) of the AnaCredit Regulation
26 as the counterparty that grants protection against a contractually agreed negative
27 credit event and that bears the credit risk of the negative credit event.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 41
31 May 2019
1 In the context of AnaCredit reporting, every protection item is granted by a protection
2 provider. For example, if real estate serves as protection, the owner of the real
3 estate is the protection provider. If government bonds owned by a legal entity are
4 pledged to secure an instrument (a loan), the legal entity is the protection provider.
5 The protection provider typically differs from the counterparty that issues the
6 protection, although the two do coincide for some types of protection. For instance,
7 guarantors who issue guarantees also act as protection providers –
8 cf. Section 6.2.2.4.
9 A protection provider is clearly distinguished from a debtor, and the distinction
10 between the debtor and the protection provider vis-à-vis an instrument is based on
11 who bears the unconditional obligation to make payments under the instrument. In
12 particular, the debtor is the counterparty that is unconditionally obliged to pay,
13 whereas any counterparty that is conditionally obliged to make payments or to
14 otherwise cede (pledged) protection to the creditor (i.e. upon the occurrence of a
15 certain negative credit event) is the protection provider.
16 For instance, in the case of a loan the debtor is the counterparty to which the loan is
17 granted and which is unconditionally obliged to pay it back. This counterparty is also
18 the debtor if the loan is secured by a third-party financial guarantee, as the guarantor
19 is only conditionally obliged to pay, i.e. the creditor does not have the right to request
20 payment from the guarantor unless the debtor fails to meet its payment obligation.
21 Similarly, the creditor does not have the right to seize the assets of the debtor
22 pledged as protection unless the debtor fails to meet its payment obligation.
23 The distinction between a debtor and a protection provider is further illustrated in
24 Example 3 and results from the way credit is generally modelled in AnaCredit, where
25 the instrument part is separated from the protection part (cf. Section 6.1).
Example 3: Debtor or protection provider?
For the purpose of AnaCredit, the distinction between the debtor of the instrument and
the protection provider that provides a protection item securing the instrument is generally
based on who bears the unconditional obligation to make payments under the instrument.
In particular, the debtor is the counterparty that is unconditionally obliged to make
payments, whereas any counterparty that is obliged only upon the occurrence of a certain
negative credit event is the protection provider.
For a loan secured by a guarantee whereby the guarantor agrees to pay to the creditor if
the debtor defaults, the guarantor is a protection provider as it is only obliged to provide
payment upon the default of the debtor, which is not an unconditional obligation.
However, the credit relationship is recorded between the creditor and the debtor until
such time as the guarantee is called, with the guarantor as protection provider, after the
guarantee is called the guarantor has an unconditional obligation to the creditor and
therefore assumes the role of debtor. At this point, if the guarantor is also a reporting
agent in the context of AnaCredit, the guarantor may also record a claim on the debtor on
its balance sheet. The claim needs to be reported to AnaCredit, where relevant. The
reason for reporting claims arising in this way to AnaCredit is that from the moment the
guarantor pays the original creditor it becomes a (new) creditor of the debtor.

6 protection provider makes payments or otherwise transfers (pledged) assets to the creditor subsequent
7 to a contractually agreed negative credit event taking place, and may often have the
8 right to recover those funds from the debtor and is entitled to assignment of the
9 creditor’s right against the debtor. Nevertheless, the creditor exercises this right in
10 the first place.
11 Revision mark: further clarification The protection received in the form of (pledged) assets may be explicit (e.g.
regarding the protection provider is
12 mortgage claims or securities pledged as collateral) or implicit (e.g. financial leases
added in line with Q&A 2018/0051
13 and reverse repurchase agreements) in the contract. Nonetheless, irrespective of
14 how the protection is received, the protection provider cannot be the same
15 counterparty as the creditor, as protection is essentially about a transfer of the credit
16 risk where the loss absorption in the event of a default is transferred from the creditor
17 to a counterparty other than the creditor (see Article 1(11) and (13) of the AnaCredit
18 Regulation).
19 The distinction between the role of the creditor and that of the protection provider is
20 illustrated by comparing the basic mechanics of traditional and synthetic
21 securitisations, as shown in Example 4.
Example 4: Creditor and protection provider vis-à-vis securitisation transactions
With regard to instruments that are subject to securitisation, a broad distinction is made
between:
• Traditional securitisations (cf. Example 1 above).
In the case of traditional securitisations that are true sales, the transferee becomes the
new creditor of the part of the instruments over which it has acquired economic
ownership.
• Synthetic securitisations – transfer of the credit risk of an instrument (or pool of
instruments, or part thereof), through the use of credit derivatives, guarantees or
any similar mechanism to the investors in the financing instruments issued by an
FVC. FVCs in this category may not fund the instruments whose credit risk is being
transferred.
In the case of synthetic securitisations, the counterparty that assumes the credit risk of
an instrument through the use of credit derivatives, guarantees or any similar
mechanism is not a creditor but a protection provider. Consequently, if the creditor
transfers the instrument to a third party through the use of a guarantee, the transferor is
the originator of the instrument and remains the creditor, while the third party becomes
a protection provider of the instrument.

4 Instruments covered in AnaCredit
1 The purpose of this chapter is to provide a notion of what an instrument is and
2 general reporting guidelines for identifying which instruments (within lending
3 transactions) of credit institutions are subject to AnaCredit reporting.
4 Pursuant to the AnaCredit Regulation, instruments held by observed agents and
5 instruments that are serviced by resident observed agents are considered in the
6 context of AnaCredit reporting, provided that they fulfil the other conditions referred
7 to in Articles 1, 4 and 5 of the AnaCredit Regulation. The criteria triggering the
8 reporting obligations are discussed in Chapter 5.
9 In general, AnaCredit aims to provide an analytical view of credit risk regardless of
10 the financial instrument or the accounting classification. As such, the requirements
11 laid down in the AnaCredit Regulation aim to ensure that reporting agents report to
12 AnaCredit credit and credit risk data for all their observed agents. In this connection,
13 the AnaCredit Regulation distinguishes between (i) instruments held by observed
14 agents and (ii) instruments serviced by observed agents.
15 With a view to identifying the instruments subject to reporting, this chapter focuses
16 only on the counterparty roles of creditor, servicer and debtor that are indispensable
17 for determining the reporting obligation vis-à-vis an instrument. It does not refer to
18 other roles that are generally relevant for AnaCredit. For a complete list of the roles
19 of counterparties please refer to Section 3.1 in the previous chapter.
4.1 The notion of contract and instrument
4.1.1 Contract
20 Pursuant to Article 1(22) of the AnaCredit Regulation, a contract is a legally binding
21 agreement between two or more parties under which one or multiple instruments are
22 created.
23 In the context of AnaCredit, a contract is a credit agreement between two or more
24 entities, with an entity acting as debtor and an entity acting as creditor, under which
25 the creditor normally provides the debtor with funds and the debtor commits to
26 paying them back.
27 Revision mark: clarification is One credit contract can give rise to one or more instruments. Moreover, one credit

28 contract may give rise to multiple credit facilities, and each credit facility may give
more instruments under a single
29 contract rise to multiple instruments.

4.1.2 Instrument
1 In practice, instruments are typically In AnaCredit, credit is understood as any form of financial accommodation supplied
associated with an account
2 by a creditor to a debtor under a credit contract. In this connection, an instrument is a
3 specific instance of credit arising under a contract, with specified characteristics,
4 enabling the debtor to receive from the creditor funds to an amount or value
5 regulated in the contract.
6 AnaCredit considers instruments in the way that they are typically managed by credit
7 institutions, i.e. it considers instruments as banking products with outstanding
8 balances and credit limits.
9 A credit contract may be managed as a whole but may have different characteristics
10 for each instrument.
4.1.2.1 Outstanding balances and credit limits
11 Revision mark: this paragraph has From the perspective of a credit institution, instruments may have a positive or credit

13 debit balance where the counterparty (debtor) owes funds to the credit institution.

16 agreement.

19 for the respective credit limit. When a debtor exceeds the credit limits, excesses
20 occur.
21 Outstanding balances as of a given date are the total payments made by or to the
22 debtor on the instrument’s account within a given period, i.e. the balance of the
23 instrument’s account at any point in time is the outstanding balance of the
24 instrument. In other words, outstanding balances are the amount of credit owed by
25 the debtor at a given point in time. For most instruments this is the total amount of
26 drawings and other amounts that are open under the instrument.

12 Part III of the Manual which deals specifically with credit facilities and credit cross-
13 limits.
Revision mark: the paragraph
about undrawn amounts has been
moved down to Section 4.6.3
4.1.3 Type of instrument
14 The type of instrument is used to classify instruments depending on certain
15 characteristics.
16 Pursuant to Article 1(23) of the AnaCredit Regulation, only those instruments that are
17 specified in the data attribute “type of instrument”, as defined in Annex IV, are
18 considered for AnaCredit reporting. These types are:
19 • Reverse repurchase agreements
20 • Deposits other than reverse repurchase agreements
21 • Overdraft
22 • Credit card debt
23 • Revolving credit other than overdrafts and credit card debt
24 • Credit lines other than revolving credit
25 • Trade receivables
26 • Financial leases
27 • Other loans
28 This means that any instruments which do not fall under any of the types listed
29 above are not considered in AnaCredit.
30 As regards the distinction between the different types of instrument, more detailed
31 guidance is provided in Section 3.4.1 in Part II of the Manual, which deals specifically
32 with the instrument dataset where the data attribute “type of instrument” is

9 servicer is the counterparty responsible for the administrative and financial

11 same counterparty typically acts as both the creditor and the servicer, there are
12 instruments for which the two roles are assumed by different counterparties.
13 Instruments with a distinct creditor Every instrument for which a debtor and a creditor are expressly distinguished as

14 different counterparties (also including different institutional units) is subject to credit
credit risk because the creditor may
15 not receive the payment that he has risk, which means that the creditor may not receive (in full) a payment which it has
the right to receive from the debtor
16 the right to receive under the instrument. In other words, such an instrument gives
17 rise to credit risk for the creditor.

5 because the instrument is reported by both the creditor and the servicer which

7 To establish whether an instrument is subject to AnaCredit reporting, it is necessary
8 to consider which roles the observed agent assumes.
9 All counterparties which act as As a general rule, the observed agent may assume the roles of both creditor and
creditors, debtors, servicers and
10 servicer, or just take one of the two roles (either creditor or servicer), in relation to

12 From the perspective of an observed agent, a distinction is made between:
(a) instruments in which the observed agent acts as creditor;
(b) instruments in which the observed agent does not act as creditor but
does act as servicer;
(c) instruments in which the observed agent acts neither as creditor nor as
servicer.

14 relation to an instrument by comparing the relationship between the creditor’s role
15 and the servicer’s role.

as an asset if it is not the creditor.

reporting obligation to AnaCredit (cases I and II, indicated in green);
• instruments in relation to which the observed agent acts as servicer but does not
act as creditor are subject to AnaCredit reporting only if certain conditions apply

servicer are not required to be reported to AnaCredit (case IV, indicated in red).
1 The cross-tabulation helps understand how the two different roles are related to each
2 other. A total of four possibilities exist and are described below.
3 Case I. Observed agent is the creditor and the servicer
4 Instruments in this class are This case comprises all instruments in which the observed agent acts as both
considered for AnaCredit reporting
5 creditor and servicer.
6 In the context of AnaCredit, this case is considered to represent the most common
7 situation, because for the majority of instruments the creditor is typically also
8 responsible for their administrative and financial management.
31 May 2019
1 Examples of such instruments include loans granted by a credit institution, which is
2 also responsible for their administrative and financial management.
3 In a synthetic securitisation the Other examples include synthetic securitisations where the credit risk of (a portfolio

4 of) the instruments is transferred by means of a credit protection agreement, without
servicer
5 transferring the ownership of the securitised instruments, i.e. leaving the underlying
6 instrument in the ownership of the observed agent and on its balance sheet. More
7 specifically, although the credit risk of the observed agent is mitigated by a credit
8 derivative or a financial guarantee, the observed agent retains the right to receive the
9 payment from the debtor of the instrument and therefore meets the definition of a
10 creditor. Consequently, the observed agent acts as creditor and servicer of
11 instruments subject to synthetic securitisations. For more details regarding the
12 effects of synthetic securitisations on AnaCredit reporting, please refer to Chapter 6
13 in Part III of the Manual, which deals specifically with securitisations.
14 Instruments in this class are considered for reporting to AnaCredit.
15 Case II. Observed agent acts as creditor but does not act as servicer
16 This case comprises all instruments in which the observed agent acts as creditor but
17 where the responsibility for the administrative and financial management of the
18 instrument remains with a counterparty other than the observed agent.
19 Examples of such instruments include deposits placed by a credit institution with a
20 foreign branch of the credit institution, which are then placed on the market by the
21 foreign branch. Please note that the deposits involve the credit institution assuming
22 the credit risk (as creditor), while the foreign branch is the servicer.
23 A trustee is the holder of a financial Other examples include fiduciary loans when seen from the perspective of the
asset on behalf of a trustor
24 trustor, i.e. the entity that bears the credit risk. The trustor places these loans with a
(beneficiary)
25 third-party credit institution (trustee) in a fiduciary capacity, and they are then placed
26 on the market. In this situation the trustor acts as creditor and the third-party credit
27 institution acts as servicer.
28 Instruments in this class are considered for AnaCredit reporting.
29 Case III. Observed agent acts as servicer but does not act as creditor
30 The third case covers instruments where the observed agent does not act as creditor
31 but does act as servicer of such instruments.
32 In a traditional securitisation the Examples of such instruments include traditional securitisations that are a “true sale”,
observed agent acts as servicer but
33 where the observed agent transfers an instrument to a FVC but retains servicing
not creditor
34 rights. In such securitisation transactions the observed agent is responsible for the
35 administrative and financial management of the instrument but does not act as
36 creditor of the instrument. The creditor of such instruments is the FVC.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 53
31 May 2019
1 Other examples include fiduciary instruments14 where a credit institution (trustee)
2 places deposits on behalf of its clients (for instance with regard to their dealing room
3 transactions) in a fiduciary capacity (i.e. the risk is borne by the client and not by the
4 credit institution). In this case the credit institution does not act as creditor but only as
5 servicer.
6 Instruments in this class are considered for reporting as they may be relevant.
7 However, whether instruments are actually reported depends on whether or not they
8 are assets of the observed agent (i.e. when the observed agent reports these
9 instruments as assets in accordance with the applicable accounting standard) or
10 whether or not the third party that acts as creditor of those instruments is a (part of a)
11 resident credit institution – please refer to Section 4.3 for details.

15 Case IV above comprises no cases relevant for AnaCredit reporting and is not
16 considered further.
4.3 Activities of an observed agent in the context of Article
4(1)(a)(i)-(iv)
17 Pursuant to Article 1(9) of the AnaCredit Regulation, AnaCredit requires that
18 instruments in which an observed agent acts as creditor or servicer are reported.
19 From the perspective of an observed agent, a distinction is made between the
20 activity of the observed agent as creditor and the activity of the observed agent as
21 servicer.
22 Insofar as instruments in relation to which the observed agent acts as creditor are
23 reportable under Article 4(1)(a)(i)-(iv), instruments in relation to which the observed
24 agent acts only as servicer are not automatically considered relevant for reporting.
25 Chart 8 presents a decision tree to help determine which instruments are relevant in
26 the context of AnaCredit considering solely Article 4(1)(a)(i)-(iv).

4.3.1 The activity of the observed agent as creditor
1 The activity of the observed agent as creditor vis-à-vis an instrument implies that the
2 instrument gives rise to credit risk for the observed agent. In this case, the
3 instrument is subject to AnaCredit reporting (irrespective of whether or not the
4 observed agent is the servicer of such instrument) because it fulfils the condition
5 described in Article 4(1)(a)(i) of the AnaCredit Regulation:
(i) gives rise to credit risk for the observed agent.
6 The activity of the observed agent as creditor is covered in cases I and II, as referred
7 to in Section 4.2.
8 Please note that although instruments for which the observed agent acts as creditor
9 generally constitute assets of the observed agent, for the condition in Article
10 4(1)(a)(i) to be fulfilled it is irrelevant whether or not an instrument is an asset of the
11 observed agent under Article 4(1)(a)(ii) and (iii), as long as the observed agent acts
12 as creditor of such instruments.

1 Similarly, whether or not the observed agent is resident in a reporting Member State
2 is of no relevance.
3 The specific kinds of instrument relevant for this section are discussed in more detail
4 in Section 4.4, which deals specifically with instruments relevant for the activity as
5 creditor.
6 For example, intracompany loans for which the observed agent acts as creditor fulfil
7 the condition in Article 4(1)(a)(i). This is further described in Section 4.6.5.
4.3.2 The activity of the observed agent as servicer
8 If the reporting obligation in respect of an instrument is not triggered by an observed
9 agent acting as creditor of the instrument, it may still be triggered by an observed
10 agent acting as servicer.
11 According to Article 1(14) of the AnaCredit Regulation, a servicer is the counterparty
12 responsible for the administrative and financial management of an instrument, and
13 case III, as referred to in Section 4.2, may arise under any of the following conditions
14 of Article 4(1)(a)(ii), (iii), (iv) (i.) and (iv) (ii.) where the instrument:
(ii) is an asset of the observed agent, or
(iii) is recognised under the relevant accounting standard used by the
observed agent’s legal entity and gave rise to credit risk for the observed
agent in the past, or
(iv) is serviced by the observed agent resident in a reporting Member State;
and
i. was granted to other institutional units of the same legal entity that the
observed agent is part of, or
ii. is held by a legal entity which is not a credit institution resident in a
reporting Member State different to the observed agent.
15 Please note that Article 4(1)(a)(iii) is considered to be superseded by Article
16 4(1)(a)(ii) – cf. Section 4.4.1 – and is not analysed separately.
17 Instruments which are subject to a traditional securitisation in which an FVC
18 acquiring the instruments acts as creditor and the observed agent that retains

21 creditor fulfil the condition in Article 4(1)(a)(iv).
22 Instruments in which a non-resident Please note that instruments that are assets of the observed agent for which the

8 Please note that instruments considered in this section are those where the
9 observed agent does not act as creditor. Instruments where the observed agent acts

11 The specific kinds of instrument relevant for this section are discussed in more detail
12 in Section 4.5, which deals specifically with instruments relevant for the activity as
13 servicer but not as creditor.

17 agent. It is irrelevant whether or not such instruments are actually serviced by the
18 observed agent.
19 Depending on the applicable accounting standard, an instrument for which the
20 observed agent acts as creditor may be an asset of the observed agent or an off-
21 balance sheet item. This is described in more detail in the subsequent sections.

31 accordance with Article 1(9), to economic assets recorded on the balance sheet of

35 the same meaning as “is an asset of the observed agent” as referred to in
36 Article 4(1)(a)(ii). Consequently, Article 4(1)(a)(iii) – regarding instruments

4 considered separately.
5 In general, a counterparty may be the legal and/or economic owner of an asset. The
6 economic owner bears the risks and is entitled to claim the benefits associated with
7 the asset. The economic owner thus treats the instrument as an asset. Therefore,
8 the economic owner reports to AnaCredit according to Article 4(1)(a)(i) and (ii).

12 loans, in accordance with some accounting standards other than IFRS), the legal
13 owner may treat the instrument as an asset on its balance sheet. If this is the case,
14 the legal owner has a reporting obligation to AnaCredit according to Article 4(1)(a)(ii)
15 even though the instrument does not give rise to credit risk for the legal owner.
4.4.2 Instruments not recognised under the relevant accounting standard

AnaCredit even though observed
20 agents may prepare a balance entity. Nonetheless, the accounting standard applied by the observed agent’s legal
sheet separate from the observed
21 agent’s legal entity entity is the only relevant accounting standard under AnaCredit.
22 Revision mark: a qualification of The general principle is that the category of instruments in which the observed agent
the assets is added
23 acts as creditor is broader than the category of instruments that are assets of the
24 observed agent under the relevant accounting standard. Such instruments include:
(a) intracompany loans, where the observed agent grants a loan to another
institutional unit of the legal entity of which the observed agent is part
(these loans are not assets recognised under the accounting standard of
the observed agent’s legal entity);
(b) instruments that are written off, where the observed agent still has a claim
on a third party (debtor) but the instruments are no longer recognised
under the applicable accounting standard.
25 Such instruments are subject to AnaCredit reporting in line with the general criteria
26 triggering the reporting obligation as discussed in Chapter 5, which include the
27 debtor’s commitment amount.
28 As regards written-off instruments in particular, such instruments are reported as
29 long as the debtor’s commitment amount reaches or exceeds the reporting threshold
30 of €25,000, or until the end of the quarter in which instruments were written off if the
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 58
31 May 2019
1 debtor’s commitment amount is less than €25,000. This is further explained in
2 Section 5.2.2.2.
4.5 Instruments relevant for the activity as servicer but not as
creditor
3 This section considers instruments where the observed agent acts only as servicer
4 and the instrument is not subject to reporting by the creditor of the instrument.
5 Instruments in which the observed agent is also the creditor are considered in
6 Section 4.4.
7 Please note that if an NCB grants a In the case of an instrument held by a third party (i.e. in which a third party acts as
derogation in accordance with
8 creditor), the activity of an observed agent located in a reporting Member State as

9 Regulation to a credit institution servicer to the instrument is subject to AnaCredit reporting if the activity of the third
which holds an instrument, the
10 party as creditor of the instrument is not already subject to AnaCredit reporting. In
instrument is still not subject to
11 reporting by the servicer. this connection, the AnaCredit Regulation stipulates that the instrument serviced by
12 the observed agent (which does not act as creditor) is subject to reporting if the
13 instrument is not held by a (part of a) credit institution resident in a reporting Member
14 State.
15 For instance, instruments that are subject to a traditional securitisation where the
16 observed agent transfers the instrument to an FVC while retaining servicing rights
17 are in principle considered to fulfil the conditions of Article 4(1)(a)(iv)(ii). Upon the
18 transfer of the instrument, the observed agent acts as servicer (and originator) of the
19 instrument, whereas the FVC, upon acquiring the right to receive the principal and
20 interest payments for the instrument, acts as creditor of the instrument. As the FVC
21 is not a credit institution, the instrument, which is serviced by the observed agent, is
22 only subject to reporting (in relation to the activity of the observed agent as servicer
23 but not creditor) if the observed agent is resident in a reporting Member State. The
24 country of residence of the FVC is irrelevant with regard to the reporting obligation of
25 the observed agent.
26 However, an instrument serviced by an observed agent not resident in a reporting
27 Member State is not considered to be subject to AnaCredit reporting, provided that
28 the observed agent does not act as creditor of such an instrument.
29 Chart 8 in Section 4.3 presents a decision tree which summarises the reporting
30 obligations from the observed agent’s perspective, where the boxes in orange focus
31 on instruments that are serviced but not held by the observed agent.
32 Please note that – broadly speaking – securitised or otherwise transferred
33 instruments in relation to which the observed agent acts as servicer constitute the
34 main category of instruments relevant for the activity as servicer but not as creditor.
35 The category also includes fiduciary instruments, where the trustee is the observed
36 agent. Such instruments are discussed in more detail in the following sections.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 59
31 May 2019
4.5.1 Not reporting serviced instruments to avoid double reporting
1 Instruments that are serviced (but not held) by one observed agent and held by
2 another observed agent are in principle subject to double reporting. However, the
3 AnaCredit Regulation aims to avoid double reporting in such cases by requiring in
4 Article 4(1)(a)(iv)(ii) that serviced instruments are reported only on condition that they
5 are not held by another observed agent.
6 More specifically, given the fact that instruments held by observed agents are in
7 principle subject to mandatory AnaCredit reporting, double reporting – which
8 essentially could arise in the case of instruments that are held by one observed
9 agent but serviced by another observed agent – is avoided by exempting the activity
10 of the servicer from reporting.
11 In this connection, the provisions of Article 4(1)(a)(iv)(ii) should be interpreted to mean,
12 in respect of instruments in which a third party acts as creditor, that the activity of an
13 observed agent located in a reporting Member State as servicer to the instrument is
14 subject to reporting to AnaCredit only if the third party acting as creditor to the
15 instrument is not a (part of a) credit institution resident in a reporting Member State.

expanded
Example 5: Same instrument held by one observed agent and serviced by another
This example considers a fiduciary instrument (cf. Section 4.5.3) from the perspectives
of the trustor and the trustee:
• trustor C holds an instrument which gives rise to credit risk;
• the instrument is serviced by trustee A, who acts as trustee for trustor C;
• counterparty B is the debtor of the instrument; counterparty B is a legal entity.
The fiduciary instrument is first considered from the trustor C perspective:
If trustor C is an observed agent then reporting of the instrument is triggered by Article
4(1)(a)(i) – the instrument gives rise to credit risk for the observed agent.
Conclusion: the reporting agent relevant for the observed agent (trustor C) reports the
instrument.
The instrument is now considered from the trustee A perspective:
Scenario 1 – the instrument is not an asset of trustee A in accordance with the relevant
accounting standard.
If trustee A is an observed agent resident in a reporting Member State, reporting of the
instrument is triggered if trustor C is not a credit institution (or a foreign branch of a
credit institution) resident in a reporting Member State. In such cases reporting is
exclusively triggered by Article 4(1)(a)(iv)(ii).
If trustor C is a credit institution (or a foreign branch of a credit institution) resident in a
reporting Member State, the instrument is not required to be reported by the reporting
agent related to the observed agent (trustee A).
Scenario 2 – the instrument is an asset of trustee A recognised under the applicable
accounting standard.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 60
31 May 2019
If trustee A is an observed agent, reporting of the instrument is triggered by Article
4(1)(a)(ii), irrespective of whether or not trustee A is resident in a reporting Member
State. It is also irrelevant whether or not trustor C is a credit institution (or a foreign
branch of a credit institution) resident in a reporting Member State. When the trustor is
also an observed agent, double reporting to AnaCredit occurs because the same
instrument is reported by both the trustor (in accordance with Article 4(1)(a)(i)) and the
trustee (in accordance Article 4(1)(a)(ii)).
4.5.2 Securitised or otherwise transferred instruments except synthetic
securitisations

identify the originator with regard to
10 securitisation transactions (the transferor) and the recognition of the instrument by the new owner on its
11 balance sheet. The transferor is no longer to be identified as the creditor but as the
12 originator. The transferee, which is the new owner of the instrument from an
13 economic perspective, is to be recognised as the creditor. If the transferor retains
14 servicing rights in respect of the transferred instruments, the transferor is also
15 recognised as the servicer. From the perspective of an observed agent who acts as
16 servicer, such instruments therefore are in principle considered for AnaCredit
17 reporting.
18 In the case of transfers of instruments according to Part 5 of the BSI Regulation,
19 other than securitisation transactions, where the economic ownership of the
20 instrument has been partly or fully transferred to a third party, the counterparty
21 responsible for its administrative and financial management may differ from the
22 creditor. The counterparty which originally held the instrument generally (but not
23 necessarily) remains the servicer.
24 For more information regarding instruments subject to securitisation please refer to
25 Chapter 6 in Part III of the Manual.
4.5.3 Fiduciary instruments
26 From the perspective of an observed agent, fiduciary instruments are those for which
27 the observed agent acts in its own name but on behalf of and with the risk borne by a
28 third party. The third party who is the economic owner of the instruments is therefore
29 the creditor. The observed agent, who is solely responsible for the administrative and
30 financial management of the instruments, is the servicer of such instruments.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 61
31 May 2019
1 Fiduciary instruments in which the observed agent acts only as servicer are
2 generally subject to AnaCredit reporting. However, the exact reporting obligation
3 depends on their accounting treatment.
4 As discussed in Sections 4.3.2 and 4.5.1, fiduciary instruments may or may not be
5 assets of the trustee. If the trustee is an observed agent, the observed agent acts as
6 servicer but does not act as creditor of such instruments. Fiduciary instruments are
7 therefore reported to AnaCredit according to Article 4(1)(a)(ii) or (iii) of the AnaCredit
8 Regulation if they are treated as assets, regardless of whether or not the creditor is
9 an observed agent.
10 In particular, non-asset fiduciary instruments are only reported to AnaCredit if the
11 servicer (trustee) to such instruments is an observed agent resident in a reporting
12 Member State whereas the creditor (trustor) is not a credit institution (or a foreign
13 branch of a credit institution) resident in a reporting Member State.
14 Please note that only certain data attributes of the accounting dataset are applicable
15 for non-asset fiduciary instruments and proper values can be reported.
4.6 Other instrument-related aspects for consideration
16 This section focuses on certain features of instruments that affect their reporting to
17 AnaCredit.
4.6.1 Instruments recorded on the liabilities side of the balance sheet
18 In accordance with Section 4.4, instruments that give rise to credit risk to the
19 observed agent are either assets of the observed agent or are not recorded on the
20 balance sheet. Such instruments are never liabilities of the observed agent,
21 however.
22 Conversely, any instruments that are of any of the specified types but are a liability of
23 the observed agent are not considered for reporting.
24 Revision mark: the example is Example 6 provides clarification on which deposits are considered and which ones
expanded in line with
25 disregarded for AnaCredit reporting.
Q&A 2018/0014 on nostro/vostro
accounts
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 62
31 May 2019
Example 6: Which deposits are considered and which deposits are not within the
scope of AnaCredit
In accordance with Regulation 549/2013, interbank positions between credit institutions
are generally referred to as deposits. For example, this is mentioned in points 5.81,
5.114, but most notably in point 5.119 thereof.
To this end, although deposits are in principle the type of instrument considered in
AnaCredit, in no case does it imply that any deposits that are recorded on the liabilities
side of the balance sheet fall within the scope of AnaCredit.
As a matter of fact, placements of funds between credit institutions are always recorded
as deposits, irrespective of whether they are on the assets or liabilities side. To be
considered for AnaCredit, however, a deposit should give rise to credit risk for the
observed agent. Specifically, the only deposits that fall within the scope of AnaCredit
are assets in accordance with Article 4(1)(a)(ii) or give rise to credit risk for the observed
agent in accordance with Article 4(1)(a)(i). Consequently, no deposits on the liabilities
side (i.e. received deposits) fall within the scope of the collection.
If, however, the deposit’s balance on the reporting reference data is such that the
observed agent has a claim on the other credit institution – i.e. it is the observed agent’s
funds that are on deposit – the deposit balance is subject to AnaCredit reporting. This is
particularly relevant for nostro/vostro accounts.
A nostro/vostro account is a bank account where one bank has another bank’s funds on
deposit, typically on behalf of a foreign bank in relation to international trade or other
financial transactions. This also involves deposit overdrafts, whereby depositors are
authorised to obtain funding in the form of an overdraft. The terms “nostro” and “vostro”
are used to indicate which bank has money on deposit.
A nostro/vostro account is only subject to AnaCredit reporting if, on the reporting
reference date, the account’s balance is such that the observed agent has a claim on
the other credit institution – i.e. it is the observed agent’s money that is on deposit in the
account (“nostro”). Conversely, “vostro” balances are not subject to AnaCredit reporting.
As the balance of a nostro/vostro account can change from one reporting reference
date to another – changing, for example, from “nostro” to “vostro” and back again – the
account may not be subject to AnaCredit reporting on all reporting reference dates.
4.6.2 Instruments that are not eligible

2 of the types of instrument referred to in Article 1(23) of the AnaCredit Regulation do
instruments outside the scope of
3 the collection not fall within the scope of the collection (for example, debt securities, financial
4 guarantees and commitments given).
5 With this in mind, Example 7 describes an instrument which gives rise to credit risk
6 for the observed agent but is not considered to be subject to AnaCredit reporting.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 63
31 May 2019
Example 7: Financial guarantees given by a credit institution (observed agent)
A credit institution (bank X) whose activity as creditor or servicer is reported by its
reporting agent provides, upon request by company C, a financial guarantee to
company C that if company B, a client of bank X, fails to meet its payment obligation
towards company C, bank X will pay a guaranteed amount to company C.
In this case the guarantee given by bank X is an instrument giving rise to credit risk for
bank X. However, guarantees given are not one of the types of instrument referred to in
Article 1(23) and such instruments therefore fall outside the scope of the collection.
Nevertheless, if company B fails to meet its payment obligation and bank X pays out the
amount guaranteed to company C, then the guarantee becomes a loan for which bank
X acts as creditor (as bank X has the right to receive payment from company B) and is
reported by bank X (in its capacity as an observed agent) (cf. “other loans” in
Section 3.4.1 in Part II of the Manual).
4.6.3 Off-balance-sheet items in the scope of AnaCredit
1 Revision mark: Section 4.6.3 is Instruments that are held or serviced by the observed agent are subject to AnaCredit

4 one debtor of the instrument is not a natural person and that the type of instrument is
5 within the scope of Article 1(23) of the AnaCredit Regulation) for which the off-
6 balance-sheet amount is relevant.
7 Overall, as regards off-balance-sheet items, AnaCredit differentiates between
8 “undrawn amounts”, which are off‑balance-sheet components of instruments eligible
9 for reporting to AnaCredit (cf. Section 4.6.3.1), and strict off-balance-sheet items.
10 Strict off-balance-sheet items, such as loan commitments, financial guarantees and
11 other commitments as defined in paragraphs 113, 114 and 115 of Part 2 of Annex V
12 to Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 680/2014 of 16 April 2014, as
13 amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 2017/1443 of 29 June
14 2017 (hereinafter referred to as “the amended ITS”), which do not have outstanding
15 balances are not considered to be any of the types of instrument referred to in Article
16 1(23) of the AnaCredit Regulation.
17 In particular, in accordance with paragraph 113 of Part 2 of Annex V to the amended
18 ITS, “loan commitments” are firm commitments to provide credit under pre-specified
19 terms and conditions, except those that are derivatives because they can be settled
20 net in cash or by delivering or issuing another financial instrument. They include:
21 • “forward deposits”;
22 • “undrawn credit facilities” which comprise agreements to “lend” or provide
23 “acceptance facilities” under pre-specified terms and conditions.
24 As regards other products referred to, such as letters of credit or guarantees, these
25 are reported only as protection received items for the creditor. They are not reported

1 as instruments, as they do not fall within the types of instrument referred to in Article
2 1(23) of the AnaCredit Regulation.
4.6.3.1 Instruments comprising off-balance-sheet amounts
3 This section provides relevant clarification with regard to instruments which consist
4 of off-balance-sheet (undrawn) amounts.
5 Revision mark: this paragraph is Whether there is any off-balance-sheet amount for an instrument depends on (a) the
consolidated with the clarifications
6 general drawing possibilities vis-à-vis the instrument (for example, some instruments
moved down from Section 4.1.2.1
7 by definition do not have any off-balance-sheet amount) and (b) whether the
8 instrument is associated with a credit limit. In respect of (a), the following distinction
9 is made:
(i) a revolving credit is an instrument under a credit contract whereby the
debtor’s outstanding balances are permitted to fluctuate (i.e. increase and
decrease) such that, taking into account payments made by or to the credit
of the debtor, the credit limit is not exceeded;
(ii) a non-revolving credit is an instrument under a credit contract whereby the
debtor is enabled to receive funds (whether in one amount or in
instalments) which are not replenished after payments are made by the
debtor (or to the instrument of the debtor).
10 As regards (b), there are three generic types of credit limits and all types of credit
11 limits can essentially be set using these generic types of credit limits:
(iii) credit cross-limits, which are given to limit the amount of credit for two or
more related instruments; instruments under a credit cross-limit may have
credit sub-limits;
(iv) credit sub-limits, which are individual credit limits set for instruments under
a credit cross-limit that limit the amount of credit that a debtor can have
under a given instrument;
(v) independent credit limits, which are individual credit limits that do not have
a superior credit limit (i.e. a credit cross-limit) to restrict the use of credit
thereunder.
12 Revision mark: an explanation is The above implies that, while certain types of instrument reported to AnaCredit can
added in line with Q&A 2018/0010
13 only have a positive outstanding nominal amount, there are also reportable types of
14 instrument for which the outstanding nominal amount may be zero (and for which
15 there is an intrinsic off-balance-sheet amount).
16 More guidance regarding reporting in the case of credit cross-limit structures (e.g.
17 multi-product credit facilities) is provided in Section 3.4 in Part III of the Manual,
18 which deals specifically with the subject of multiple instruments linked to a single

5 In the context of AnaCredit, intercompany loans for which the observed agent acts
6 as creditor or servicer are essentially no different from any other instruments for
7 which the observed agent is the creditor or servicer and the same reporting
8 requirements apply. More specifically, if a legal entity holding such an instrument is
9 an observed agent in AnaCredit, the instrument is subject to reporting following the
10 instructions in Section 4.4.1.

12 another institutional unit of the same legal entity – e.g. between the domestic part
with the glossary
13 and a foreign branch of the legal entity or between two foreign branches of the same
14 legal entity.
15 In the context of AnaCredit, intracompany loans are subject to reporting primarily
16 because the observed agent that extends such loans acts as creditor of these
17 instruments. Furthermore, loans between institutional units are also reported in the
18 context of BSI statistics.
19 Intracompany loans may be registered on the balance sheet of the institutional unit,
20 but these intracompany loans are not recognised on the balance sheet of the legal
21 entity. Consequently, no accounting information is required in the accounting dataset
22 for such loans. In fact, intracompany loans for which the observed agent acts as
23 creditor meet the condition in Article 4(1)(a)(i). In this respect it is irrelevant whether
24 or not such instruments are serviced by the observed agent.
25 In the AnaCredit Regulation, credit risk is defined at the level of institutional units. In
26 accordance with Article 1(21), credit risk is the risk that a counterparty fails to make
27 any payments that it is contractually obliged to make, while pursuant to Article 1(10)
28 a counterparty is an institutional unit.

Chart 9: Stylised intracompany loans to foreign branches
Intracompany loans are loans extended by one unit of a legal entity to another unit of
the same legal entity. Companies make intracompany loans to, for example, shift cash
within business units that use a common currency, rather than sending in funds from a
foreign location that will be subject to exchange rate fluctuations.
In the context of AnaCredit, intracompany loans within credit institutions are captured at
the level of the institutional unit.
In this example, a credit institution established in France extends intracompany loans to
its foreign branches in Italy, Spain and the USA.

The domestic part
Reporting agent Foreign branches
In all these intracompany loans, the creditor is the observed agent located in France,
which is the domestic part of the credit institution. The debtors are the respective foreign
branches that receive the loans. All the intracompany loans are subject to AnaCredit
reporting (provided that they fulfil the conditions set out in Articles 1, 4 and 5 of the
AnaCredit Regulation).
The loans are reported to AnaCredit via the reporting agent on behalf of the observed
agent that is the creditor of these loans, i.e. the institutional unit of the credit institution
that is located in France.

8 to AnaCredit.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 67
31 May 2019
Example 8: Reporting of intracompany vostro/nostro accounts
A credit institution runs a nostro/vostro account, which it uses to settle (intracompany)
transactions with its foreign branch.
Initially, on 31 March 2019, the balance of the nostro/vostro account is such that the
domestic part of the credit institution has a claim on the foreign branch (i.e. the account
is a nostro account from the perspective of the domestic part of the credit institution). In
this case, an instrument (i.e. “deposits other than reverse repurchase agreements”) is
reported to AnaCredit, whereby the domestic part is reported as both the creditor and
the servicer and the foreign branch is reported as the debtor.
Later, on 30 April 2019, the balance of the nostro/vostro account is such that the foreign
branch has a claim on the domestic part of the credit institution (i.e. the account is a
nostro account from the perspective of the foreign branch). In this case, the foreign
branch is the observed agent and is reported as the creditor and the domestic part is
reported as both the debtor and the servicer).
Intracompany loans made within
1 institutional units are not subject to Intracompany loans provided between branch offices of a credit institution located in
reporting
2 the same country (as opposed to foreign branches in different countries) are not
3 subject to AnaCredit reporting because these are loans made within a single
4 institutional unit. This is because units of a single entity located in a single country
5 form a single institutional unit, and any transactions within institutional units are not
6 recognised in AnaCredit.
4.6.5.2 Serviced intracompany loans
7 Although for the vast majority of intracompany loans the institutional unit which
8 extends such loans is an observed agent whose activity as creditor is subject to
9 reporting pursuant to Article 4(1)(a)(i), the AnaCredit Regulation also requires
10 intracompany loans in which the observed agent acts only as servicer to be reported,
11 provided that the observed agent is resident in a reporting Member State.
12 In particular, intracompany loans where the observed agent, resident in a reporting
13 Member State, is a servicer (but not a creditor) fulfil the condition in Article
14 4(1)(a)(iv)(i).
15 Intracompany loans serviced by Intracompany loans are therefore subject to AnaCredit reporting not only in relation

22 instrument becomes relevant for AnaCredit reporting.

1 Generally, an instrument first becomes subject to reporting at the moment at which
2 the creditor enables the debtor to draw funds after entering into a legally binding
3 agreement with the debtor, or when funds are disbursed to the debtor for the first
4 time in the case of overdrafts that are not associated with an agreed credit limit.
5 Moreover, whether the creditor makes a commitment to the debtor in irrevocable or

7 an instrument.

10 the moment at which the creditor, at or after the moment of contractual inception and
11 after communicating and legally defining the commitment, creates an eligible
12 instrument giving the debtor the possibility of taking advantage of funds. This could,
13 for example, be a credit limit (regardless of whether it has been communicated to the
14 debtor) which has not resulted in the creation of an eligible instrument (e.g. a credit
15 card account or an overdraft). Clearly, such a commitment/offer will not result in any
16 reporting to AnaCredit until a standby instrument has been created which may be
17 utilised by the debtor solely at the debtor’s discretion. The same is true of conditional
18 lending agreements prior to the creation of an eligible instrument that is subject to
19 AnaCredit reporting (cf. Part III of the Manual, which deals specifically with
20 instruments arising under off-balance-sheet items).

15 Instruments giving rise to credit risk can generally be either irrevocable or revocable, based on
the following definitions:
• “irrevocable” refers to any instrument where the credit institution confirms to the debtor in
irrevocable and legally binding terms that it is prepared to make available a certain amount
(credit limit) during a predefined period of time, subject to certain terms and conditions stipulated
in the credit contract;
• “revocable” refers to any instrument (documented in a credit agreement) which can be
cancelled or drawing requests refused at any time at the sole discretion of the credit institution,
and which the credit institution has no legal obligation to renew beyond its original tenor.
Please note that the “irrevocable” effect is reflected to the extent that, once the debtor complies
with the terms and conditions (including loan default clauses and conditions precedent), the
credit institution has no legal right to unilaterally refuse any drawing and/or demand any
prepayment and/or cancel the facility until the (legally binding) contract underpinning the
instrument has expired.

To establish whether a (written-off) instrument is required to be reported as of a
reporting reference date:
• The reporting agent checks whether the instrument is a qualifying instrument, i.e. it
fulfils the respective conditions of Articles 4 and 5 for the corresponding month-end
date. 1
• If the instrument fulfils the respective conditions on the reporting reference date
(qualifying instrument), then the instrument is required to be reported as of the
reporting reference date.
• If the instrument does not meet the respective conditions, the reporting agent
checks whether the instrument is subject to extended quarter-end reporting. 2
• If extended quarter-end reporting applies, the instrument is reported as of the
reporting reference date
• Otherwise, the instrument is not required to be reported as of the reporting
reference date.

4 Condition B: An instrument held or serviced by the observed agent that is one of
5 the types of instrument listed above is considered in the context of AnaCredit
6 reporting provided that it fulfils any of the four conditions referred to in Article 4(1)(a).
7 The conditions are that the instrument:
(a) gives rise to credit risk for the observed agent, or
(b) is an asset of the observed agent, or
(c) is recognised under the relevant accounting standard used by the
observed agent’s legal entity and gave rise to credit risk for the observed
agent in the past, or
(d) is serviced by the observed agent resident in a reporting Member State
and
(i) was granted to other institutional units of the same legal entity that
the observed agent is part of, or
(ii) is held by a legal entity which is not a credit institution resident in a
reporting Member State different to the observed agent.
8 Condition C: Pursuant to Article 4(1)(b) of the AnaCredit Regulation, an instrument
9 held or serviced by the observed agent is only considered if at least one debtor of
10 the instrument is a legal entity or part of a legal entity as defined in Article 1(5).

Example 11: Revolving credit granted to a partnership
A revolving credit granted by the observed agent, classified as “revolving credit other
than overdrafts and credit card debt” according to the type of instrument under Article
1(23) and granted to a partnership is deemed to fulfil condition C above.
The partnership is set up by a deed of partnership, which sets out the legal relationship
between partners (how profits will be shared out, responsibilities of partners, etc.). The
partners have unlimited liability, i.e. they are jointly and severely responsible for the
debts of their partnership. The partnership is a legal entity as defined in Article 1(5) of
the AnaCredit Regulation.
Example 12: Loan granted to a natural person and a company
A mortgage loan granted by the observed agent, classified as “other loans” according to
the type of instrument under Article 1(23) and granted to a natural person and a private
company, which are jointly liable for the debt, is deemed to fulfil condition C above.

2 number of banking products held or serviced by an observed agent.
Example 13: Application of the eligibility checks
The example illustrates the applicability of the eligibility checks as of a month-end date.
The application of these checks results in an instrument being classed as either eligible
or not eligible. The banking products are first classified according to the appropriate
type of instrument, if any. Conditions A, B and C are then checked one by one. Finally,
the instruments are classified as either eligible or not eligible based on the outcome of
these checks.

For a given banking product, the type of instrument is determined based on the
definitions provided in Annex IV of the AnaCredit Regulation in the data attribute “type
of instrument”, to which Article 1(23) refers. In fact, the type of instrument is actually
determined on the basis of a number of features (laid down in the definitions of the
individual types of instrument) which go beyond the brief description provided here for
illustrative purposes.
Please note that for some banking products which are held or serviced by banks, there
may not be an appropriate type of instrument because it may not be covered by the
scope of the collection as laid down in the AnaCredit Regulation. For example, a
financial guarantee given by a bank does not have a corresponding type of instrument
in Annex IV.17
If any of the three eligibility conditions is not fulfilled, the instrument held or serviced by
the bank is not eligible. For example:
• a financial guarantee (Case 1) is not eligible because it does not correspond to any
of the type of instrument laid down in Annex IV of the AnaCredit Regulation;
• a term loan (Case 4) may not be eligible if the only debtor of the loan is a natural
person;
• an over-the-counter (OTC) derivative (Case 7) is not eligible because it does not
correspond to any of the typed of instrument laid down in Annex IV.
Please note that whether or not a particular condition is fulfilled depends on a number of
other features which are not necessarily mentioned in this description.
1 Having established whether or not an instrument is eligible, the debtor’s commitment
2 amount vis-à-vis the observed agent is considered.

10 only for such instruments. The eligibility of instruments is explained in Section 5.2.1.1.

8 qualifying instruments.
9 The starting point for the verification is the eligible instrument. Based on the eligible
10 instrument, debtors of the instrument are identified. There are two possibilities:
11 1. there is only one debtor of the eligible instrument in question;
12 2. there are two or more debtors of the eligible instrument in question.

Example 14: Calculation of the debtor’s commitment amount
This example concerns the calculation of the debtor’s commitment amount in relation to
instruments other than instruments governed under a cross-limit.
As of a month-end, client A is the only debtor of the following four instruments held or
serviced by the observed agent. Client A has no other instruments vis-à-vis the
observed agent.

Instrument 4 Eligible 12,000.00 0.00 12,000.00
Two of the instruments are deemed eligible, the other two instruments are deemed not
to be eligible.
To determine whether the reporting threshold referred to in Article 5 is reached or
exceeded, the debtor’s commitment amount is established by adding the commitment
amounts of the two eligible instruments.
The outstanding nominal amount and off-balance-sheet amount are added together for
each instrument separately. This sum is referred to as the commitment amount of the
instrument.
The debtor’s commitment amount in respect of all eligible instruments is established as
follows:
• all eligible instruments in which the debtor is involved are identified; these are
Instruments 2 and 4;
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 81
31 May 2019
• the commitment amounts of the instruments identified as eligible in the previous
step are €30,000 for Instrument 2 and €12,000 for Instrument 4;
• the two instruments that are not eligible are not considered in the calculation of the
debtor’s commitment amount vis-à-vis the observed agent;
• the debtor’s commitment amount is determined to be €42,000 (€30,000 + €12,000),
as effectively only Instruments 2 and 4 are considered.
Since the debtor’s commitment amount exceeds the reporting threshold of €25,000,
Instruments 2 and 4 are qualifying instruments as of the month-end.

3 instrument. The instrument’s commitment amount is to be included in the calculation
4 of each debtor’s commitment amount (i.e. no apportioning of the instrument’s
5 commitment amount is to be performed).
6 The conditions laid down in Article 5 of the AnaCredit Regulation are such that all
7 debtors of a multi-debtor eligible instrument are first identified. All other eligible
8 instruments held or serviced by the observed agent in which these debtors are also
9 involved are then identified for each debtor separately, irrespective of whether the
10 debtor is the only debtor or there is a plurality of debtors for any such instruments.
11 The reporting threshold condition for reporting a multi-debtor eligible instrument is
12 met if the debtor’s commitment amount exceeds €25,000 for at least one of these
13 debtors. Conversely, if the debtor’s commitment amount for all the debtor’s eligible
14 instruments does not reach or exceed €25,000 for any of the debtors, none of the
15 eligible instruments qualifies for reporting.
16 Revision mark: clarification is Once a multi-debtor eligible instrument is subject to reporting (based on the debtor’s
added regarding the requirement to
17 commitment amount of at least one legal entity), all legal entities that are debtors of
report all legal entities related to a
18 reportable instrument the instrument are reported to AnaCredit as debtors of the instrument independently
19 of their individual debtor’s commitment amounts. This is illustrated in Example 15.
Example 15: Commitment amount in the case of a multi-debtor situation
This example concerns the calculation of the debtor’s commitment amount in the case
of multi-debtor instruments, where the commitment of one of the debtors is below the
reporting threshold.
As of the month-end there is an Instrument 1 with two debtors: legal entity A and legal
entity B.
Legal entity A is a debtor of two eligible instruments vis-à-vis the observed agent:
Instrument 1 and Instrument 2. The commitment amount of Instrument 1 is €15,000 and
the commitment amount of Instrument 2 is €12,000. There are no other instruments of
the debtor vis-à-vis the observed agent.
Consequently, the debtor’s commitment amount of legal entity A exceeds €25,000.
This means that both eligible instruments (Instrument 1 and Instrument 2) of legal entity
A fall within the scope of AnaCredit and need to be reported.
With regard to legal entity B, the debtor has only one eligible instrument vis-à-vis the
observed agent, i.e. Instrument 1. The debtor’s commitment amount of legal entity B is
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 82
31 May 2019
therefore €12,000 and does not exceed the reporting threshold of €25,000.
However, as Instrument 1 is subject to reporting (based on the debtor’s commitment of
legal entity A, legal entity B is required to be reported to AnaCredit in relation to this
instrument – in fact, both legal entity A and legal entity B are required to be reported in
the counterparty-instrument dataset as debtors to Instrument 1.
In addition, since both debtors are registered in the counterparty-instrument dataset, the
counterparty reference data is also reported for both legal entity A and legal entity B.

agent. The liabilities of the debtors are defined as shown in the following tables
(Instrument 5 is the only instrument in which client B and client C are debtors):
Debtor ID Instrument ID Debtor ID Instrument ID
Client B Instrument 5 Client C Instrument 5
Client B Instrument 6 Client C Instrument 8
Client B Instrument 7 Client C Instrument 10
Client B Instrument 9
Client B is the only debtor of Instruments 6, 7 and 9 and is one of the debtors of
Instrument 5 (i.e. there is a plurality of debtors). Client C is the only debtor of
Instruments 8 and 10 and is one of the debtors of Instrument 5. There are no other
instruments vis-à-vis the observed agent in which these clients are debtors.
To determine whether the eligible instruments held or serviced by the observed agent
reach or exceed the threshold referred to in Article 5, the debtor’s commitment amount
is established for these instruments, taking into account that there are two debtors of
Instrument 5.
For client B, one of debtors of Instrument 5, the debtor’s commitment amount is
established as follows:
i. all eligible instruments in which client B is involved are identified (Instruments 5
to 7);
ii. the commitment amounts of the identified instruments are €9,000 for
Instrument 5, €3,500 for Instrument 6 and €15,000 for Instrument 7;
iii. Instrument 9 is not considered as it is not eligible;
iv. the debtor’s commitment amount for client B is determined to be €27,500
(€9,000 + €3,500 + €15,000).
For client C, the other debtor of Instrument 5, the debtor’s commitment amount is
established as follows:
i. all eligible instruments in which client C is involved are identified (Instruments 5
and 8);
ii. the commitment amounts of the identified instruments are €9,000 for
Instrument 5 and €5,000 for Instrument 8;
iii. Instrument 10 is not considered as it is not eligible;
iv. the debtor’s commitment amount for client C is determined to be €14,000
(€9,000 + €5,000).
Instrument 5 is therefore a qualifying instrument as of the month-end, as are
Instruments 6 and 7. In this case only client B’s commitment amount exceeds €25,000
and all instruments relating to client B are reported, including client C’s involvement in
Instrument 5.
However, Instrument 8 of client C (although it is an eligible instrument) is not a
qualifying instrument as of the month-end because the debtor’s commitment amount of
client C is lower than €25,000.

6 extended quarter-end reporting is of particular relevance for written-off instruments
7 and is aimed at capturing the total write-off amount via the accounting dataset as of
8 the quarter-end reporting reference date.
9 The use of the reference period when setting out the requirements in Articles 4 and 5
10 of the AnaCredit Regulation in combination with extended quarter-end reporting
11 ensures that each qualifying instrument that incurs a write-off is reported at least until
12 the end of the calendar quarter in which the debtor’s commitment amount falls below
13 the reporting threshold (as a result of the write-off).
14 By maintaining the reporting obligation for written-off instruments until the quarter-
15 end date, certain relevant information can be registered in AnaCredit which would
16 otherwise remain uncaptured. For example, the total write-off amount relating to the
17 instrument is captured in AnaCredit via the accounting dataset as of the quarter-end
18 reporting reference date.

Section 3.1.6.1 in Part II of the
21 Manual commitment amount falls below the reporting threshold of €25,000, the instruments
22 are not subject to reporting after the drop in the debtor’s commitment amount.
23 With regard to instruments with a write-off, two cases emerge, generally depending
24 on whether or not the instrument is still held or serviced by the observed agent:
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 85
31 May 2019
1 a) a written-off instrument is reported beyond the end of the quarter only if the
2 instrument is still held or serviced by the observed agent and the debtor’s
3 commitment amount is equal to or exceeds the reporting threshold of
4 €25,000 (i.e. when the debtor of the written-off instrument also has other
5 instruments vis-à-vis the observed agent and the instruments are subject to
6 reporting);
7 b) an instrument that is no longer held or serviced by the observed agent (for
8 example, when it is sold to another counterparty or debt forgiveness applies)
9 and in relation to which a write-off has taken place is reported only until the
10 end of the quarter in which the observed agent ceases to hold or service the
11 instrument.

replaced with explanations about
14 quarter-end dates end corresponding to the reporting reference date. For this purpose, the quarter-end
15 is the last calendar day of the quarter which includes the reporting reference date.
16 Example 17 illustrates how the quarter-end date is established for selected reporting
17 reference dates.
Example 17: Quarter-end for reporting reference date
The quarter-end for the reporting reference date 30 September 2018 is 30 September
2018;
• This because 30 September 2018 is also the last day of the quarter that includes
the reporting reference date.
The quarter-end for the reporting reference date 31 October 2018 is

• This is because 31 December 2018 is the last day of the quarter that includes the
reporting reference date.

19 the case of a full write-off, the operation leads to the removal of the instrument from

20 the balance sheet. Instruments are often written off when no future economic benefit
21 is expected from them, for example when a loan is considered to be uncollectible,
22 even though the institution may retain the claim against the debtor.
23 Consequently, in the event of a write-off of an instrument in relation to which the
24 observed agent acts as creditor and which was an asset under the relevant
25 accounting standard, the instrument is removed from the balance sheet, but the
26 observed agent remains the creditor of the instrument for as long as it retains the
27 claim against the debtor (i.e. the loan is not forgiven).
28 Please note that in the context of AnaCredit the accumulated write-off amount of an
29 eligible instrument is not included in the calculation of the debtor’s commitment
30 amount. However, the accumulated write-off amount of an eligible instrument that is
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 86
31 May 2019
1 fully or partially written-off is reported to AnaCredit, with the reporting obligation
2 being dependent on either the debtor’s commitment amount or the time when the
3 debtor’s commitment amount falls below the reporting threshold of €25,000 due to
4 the write-off.
5 More specifically, if the debtor’s commitment amount drops below the reporting
6 threshold of €25,000 as a result of a write-off (of one loan), the written-off loan is
7 reported until the end of the quarter in which the drop occurs. However, if the
8 debtor’s commitment amount continues to exceed the reporting threshold of €25,000
9 (despite the fact that a loan has been fully or partially written off), the written-off loan
10 is reported for as long as the instrument exists and the debtor’s commitment amount
11 continues to exceed the reporting threshold, including beyond the end of the quarter
12 in which the loan was written off). This is further illustrated in Example 18.
Example 18: General guidelines regarding reporting of written-off instruments to
AnaCredit
This example concerns an instrument in which the observed agent acts as creditor.
There is only one debtor, which is a legal entity. As of 31 March 2019, the instrument is
recognised under the relevant accounting standard and the outstanding nominal
amount is €1,000,000 (there is no off-balance-sheet amount). However, in the course of
April 2019, the creditor considers the instrument uncollectible and the instrument is
removed from the balance sheet in accordance with the applicable accounting standard.
Please note that the example focuses on determining whether or not the instrument is
subject to AnaCredit reporting at a month-end date, given a set of features related to
the instrument at that date, rather than on data attributes that are required to be
reported at the reference date. For this reason, features such as accumulated write-offs
and debtor’s commitment amount are shown in the subsequent tables, despite the fact
that they may not be required to be reported for a given reference date.
Based on the criteria triggering reporting, the instrument is subject to AnaCredit
reporting as of 31 March 2019.

Both instruments are reported until the end of the quarter in which the debtor’s
commitment amount falls below €25,000, i.e. until 30 September 2019. The instruments
are not reported thereafter.
The reason why Instrument 1 is still reported beyond the end of the quarter in which the
instrument was written off is that the observed agent still acts as creditor of the
instrument and the debtor’s commitment amount exceeds the reporting threshold in the
reference period as defined in Article 4(2) of the AnaCredit Regulation.
1 If a written-off instrument ceases to exist vis-à-vis the observed agent after a write-
2 off (for instance due to debt forgiveness or due to a sale to a third party), the
3 instrument is not required to be reported beyond the end of the quarter in which it
4 ceases to exist, irrespective of whether or not there are other instruments of the
5 debtor (vis-à-vis the observed agent) reported to AnaCredit.
6 The reason why written-off instruments are subject to AnaCredit reporting is that the
7 credit institution holds the instrument and there is a counterparty (the debtor) which
8 has an obligation to pay and, as long as the write-off does not release the debtor
9 from the obligation, the credit institution is a creditor of the instrument and bears the
10 credit risk of the instrument.

19 subject to reporting after the drop in the debtor’s commitment amount.
20 For an illustration, please see the following examples.
Example 19: The reporting of a fully repaid instrument incurring no write-off
An instrument which is reported to AnaCredit for the reporting reference dates from
31 December to 28 February is fully repaid on 14 March.
The instrument does not incur any loss in the period concerned.
Consequently, the instrument is not reported to AnaCredit as of 31 March and the last
record available in AnaCredit relates to 28 February.
Furthermore, the last quarterly information available for the instrument goes back to
31 December.
Example 20: The reporting of partially repaid instruments incurring no write-off
A debtor has only one non-revolving instrument.
On 31 January the debtor’s commitment amount is €27,000 vis-à-vis the observed
agent and the instrument is reported to AnaCredit at the reporting reference date.
On 17 February, the debtor makes a payment (e.g. of €5,000), which results in the
debtor’s commitment amount falling below the reporting threshold. The debtor’s
commitment amount does not increase thereafter. In this case, the instrument is not
reported as of 28 February or as of 31 March.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 89

A debtor has only one instrument. As of 31 January the debtor’s commitment amount is
€40,000 vis-à-vis the observed agent and the instrument is reported to AnaCredit.
As of 14 February part of the instrument is subject to securitisation, in which €20,000 is
transferred in a true sale to a special purpose vehicle (SPV). The observed agent keeps
the servicing rights of the transferred part of the instrument.
In this case, the partial transfer does not reduce the outstanding nominal amount (see
Section 4.4.3 in Part II of the Manual) and the debtor’s commitment amount is still
€40,000, even after the transfer.
Consequently, the reporting of the instrument continues after the transfer date.
Example 22: The reporting of sold instruments incurring no write-off
A debtor has only one instrument.
As of 31 March the debtor’s commitment amount is €80,000 vis-à-vis the observed
agent and the instrument is reported to AnaCredit.
On 9 April the instrument is sold to a third party. The observed agent does not keep the
servicing rights of the sold instrument.
In this case, the observed agent neither holds nor services the instrument after the sale.
Furthermore, as the observed agent does not incur a loss that needs to be captured in
AnaCredit (i.e. no write-off), the observed agent does not report the instrument after the
sale (see Section 3.1.6 in Part II of the Manual).

On 16 September 2018, the observed agent grants a credit, e.g. a term loan, to client D,
a legal entity, in the amount of €28,000, disbursed in full on that date.
The loan is a qualifying instrument. Client D has no other credit vis-à-vis the observed
agent.
On the 15th day of every month, client D repays €1,000. The relevant month-end data
for the loan are assumed to be as follows. In addition, it is verified whether the

Notably, since in cases where there is no write-off, if the debtor’s commitment amount
falls below the reporting threshold of €25,000, the instrument is not subject to reporting
after the drop in the debtor’s commitment amount (i.e. after 15 January 2019) and,
consequently, the instrument is reported to AnaCredit for the last time as of
31 December 2018.

Example 23 above is modified as follows:
On 16 May 2019, the observed agent grants to client D another credit, a balloon loan, in
the amount of €20,000, disbursed in full on that date.
The type of instrument of this credit is deemed to be “other loans”. No repayment of the
credit is agreed before 30 June 2019.

As concluded before, the term loan is not required to be reported as of 30 April 2019.
As of 31 May 2019, however, with the addition of the new credit instrument, which
raises the debtor’s commitment amount above the reporting threshold of €25,000, both
the term loan and the balloon loan are required to be reported.
Similarly, both credit instruments are required to be reported as of 30 June 2019.
In no way does the reporting obligation as of 31 May and 30 June trigger any retroactive
reporting of the term loan as of 30 April 2019.

6 Concept of credit, data model and
reportable datasets
1 This chapter addresses the concept of credit which is modelled by distinguishing
2 between three main building blocks: instrument, protection and counterparty.
3 The concept of credit is not just a data model but a whole conceptual model
4 describing how a credit is conceived for the purpose of AnaCredit.
5 After introducing the concept of credit, the chapter discusses how the concept of
6 credit is translated into reportable datasets and looks at the mutual relationships
7 between the reportable datasets. The description is threefold: first the conceptual
8 data model is discussed, then the logical data model is described, and finally the
9 specific datasets are explained on the basis of the data model.
6.1 Conceptual data model
10 The concept of credit is not just a Conceptually, the AnaCredit data model recognises three interconnected data
data model but a whole conceptual
11 entities (i.e. groups of data) related to a credit (e.g. a loan) which differ with regard to
model on how a credit is conceived
12 for the purpose of AnaCredit the data that need to be reported. These data entities are the instrument entity of the
13 credit, the protection entity of the credit and the counterparty entity of the credit.
Revision mark: the term “(data)
entity” is added and used
14 interchangeably with “part”
throughout this section
6.1.1 Concept of credit in the context of AnaCredit
15 Granular reporting to AnaCredit means that data are compiled and reported on the
16 basis of an individual credit, whereby three interrelated data entities (i.e. parts of
17 data on the credit) are distinguished.
18 In fact, the AnaCredit requirements are set out on the basis of an abstract model
19 which, at any given moment in time, represents a running credit instrument extended
20 on the basis of a contract.
21 Specifically, for the purpose of AnaCredit each instrument is assumed to be set up or
22 established on the basis of a contract (commonly referred to as a loan agreement).
23 This basis is reflected in Articles 1(22) and (23) of the AnaCredit Regulation, where
24 contract and instrument are defined. In fact, instruments are defined as specific
25 types of credit granted under a contract.
26 The abstract model underlying the AnaCredit data model has been chosen to
27 broadly reflect the general information describing credit transactions. Contracts (loan
28 or factoring agreements, for example) typically provide the terms and conditions
29 under which a creditor provides credit to a debtor, specifying for instance the amount
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 92
31 May 2019
1 of the credit, the interest charged, the repayment schedule, the conditions of the
2 credit and the representations, warranties and covenants of each party, as well as
3 taking into account the possibility that the features may change from one moment to
4 the next.
5 Revision mark: references to Generally, the AnaCredit reporting requirements involve only three data entities (i.e.
“contract” are added to emphasise
6 parts of data) which are deemed to be the main pillars of any credit granted under a
that instruments are created by
7 contracts contract. These parts are:
(a) the instrument (extended on the basis of a contract) that represents the
individual credit;
(b) the protection that secures the instrument;
(c) the counterparties that are related to or otherwise affiliated with the
instrument and the protection.
8 This means that AnaCredit requires granular information about contracts on an
9 instrument-by-instrument (commonly referred to as loan-by-loan) basis. Furthermore,
10 as each of the above-mentioned parts is characterised by a number of features, the
11 requirements of AnaCredit consist of a number of data attributes that capture certain
12 features of the specific parts of a credit arising under a contract (cf. Section 6.2.2 for
13 more details on data attributes). In fact, once a credit granted by a credit institution is
14 subject to reporting pursuant to the AnaCredit Regulation, 88 data attributes (i.e.
15 individual characteristics of the credit) are in principle required to be reported.
16 Revision marks: further Although from an IT perspective a credit (loan) is merely broken down into the three
clarifications are added in this
17 interconnected data entities (instruments, protection items and counterparties), in
paragraph
18 general terms this concept of credit has fundamental implications for how real-life
19 credit is considered for the purpose of AnaCredit. More specifically, this concept of
20 credit implies that the instrument entity of a credit is kept separate from the
21 protection entity, which is of particular relevance for products that contain embedded
22 protection (cf. Example 25 below and Section 3.4.1 in Part II of the Manual regarding
23 the instrument type “reverse repurchase agreements”). Although these products are
24 not commonly referred to as secured loans, the different data to be reported to
25 AnaCredit are in fact, under this basic premise, broken down into an instrument
26 entity (i.e. a set of data attributes with the specific information on the instrument) and
27 a protection received “entity” (i.e. a set of data attributes with the specific information
28 on the protection received). Moreover, information about who is involved in the credit
29 is placed outside the instrument/protection bracket. Counterparties are explicitly
30 distinguished from one another and clearly identified in relation to the instrument or
31 the protection.

Example 25: Reverse repurchase agreements – perspective of the buyer
Reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) are transactions in which an institution
lends cash in exchange for financial assets sold by the owner of the financial assets at
a given price under a commitment by the owner of the financial assets to repurchase
the same (or identical) assets at a fixed price on a specified future date.
Broadly speaking, a reverse repurchase agreement is a transaction concluded on the
deal date between two parties, the institution and the owner of the financial assets, in
which:
• the owner of the financial assets sells a specified financial asset to the institution at
an agreed price on date T1;
• the owner will repurchase the same (or identical) financial assets from the
institution at a price agreed on the deal date on date T2 (after T1).
Reverse repurchase agreement for the institution buying financial assets

Cash + repo interest
While the mechanics of a reverse repo involve selling and then repurchasing securities
at a set price and a set time, at its financial essence, a reverse repo is in essence a
collateralised loan.
Using this broader concept of credit, a reverse repo transaction is broken down into the
three pillars – the instrument part, the protection part and the counterparty part. In this
example, the instrument is the cash loaned out to the owner of the financial asset, while
the financial asset, which in essence collateralises the instrument, is the protection item,
and the counterparty part comprises the institution (the creditor) and the owner of the
financial asset (the debtor), which by providing the financial asset as implicit protection
to the creditor also functions as the protection provider.
Although a (reverse) repo transaction (where the financial asset is sold and later
repurchased) is conceptually modelled in exactly the same way as a collateralised loan
(where the financial asset is instead pledged as collateral for a loan), the two types of
transaction can be clearly distinguished through the information contained in AnaCredit
(more specifically, by the type of instrument).
1 In practice, the granular reporting of credit means that for each credit granted by
2 credit institutions, AnaCredit broadly requires instrument, protection and
3 debtor/creditor information. Please refer to Section 6.3 for more details on the data
4 elements that are required.
5 Using data modelling terminology, a credit is modelled as a collection of data entities
6 and relationships among data entities. In particular, the three parts of a credit are an
7 information triple that characterises the credit.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 94
31 May 2019
1 Revision mark: this paragraph is In the conceptual data model of credit, the distinct parts into which the data are
expanded with further clarifications
2 grouped on the basis of their nature are referred to as data “entities”. Consequently,
about “(data) entities”
3 a data entity is a group of data that is distinguishable from other groups of data
4 relating to the credit. The three data entities of the AnaCredit data model are:
(a) the instrument entity;
(b) the protection entity;
(c) the counterparty entity.
5 A brief description of these credit data entities is presented below. More details,
6 including the data attributes, are provided in the subsequent sections and in Part II of
7 the Manual.
6.1.2 Instrument
8 The instrument entity is at the heart of a credit. This data entity contains the
9 information about the individual credit, i.e. individual commitments with unique terms
10 under a credit agreement such as product type, maturity date, interest rate, etc.
11 Instruments arise under a contract, and for each instrument there is always a debtor,
12 a creditor and a servicer. Several instruments may be part of the same contract.
13 When defining a data model to capture instruments, it should be taken into account
14 that there may be multiple debtors of the same instrument. This implies that such
15 instruments theoretically function as the instrument entity in multiple triples (of
16 instrument, protection and counterparty). The same instrument would therefore
17 appear in several triples, with each instrument entity relating to a different debtor.
18 This implies that part of (or all) of the information relating to the instrument provided
19 in each entry could be specific to the participation of the debtor in that instrument
20 and not common across debtors.18 Generally, the data model is designed so that
21 there is no duplication of reportable information – part of the information would be
22 common across the debtors (in the instrument dataset) and another part of it specific
23 to the participation of the debtor (in the counterparty-instrument dataset). Please
24 refer to Section 6.2 for details regarding how the information is effectively organised
25 in the context of AnaCredit.
26 In the context of AnaCredit, instruments are reported gross of any protection
27 securing the instrument.
18 Entry-specific information refers to the three positions in a triple set (instrument, protection item,
counterparty) that describes a given credit transaction. This means that an instrument (or
protection item or counterparty) may occupy the position of the instrument entity (or protection
entity or counterparty entity) in multiple such triples referring to multiple credit transactions.
However, there is just one record for each instrument, protection item and counterparty. This is
because these records are the building blocks that may be combined via the identifiers to form
an unlimited number of such triple sets. Ultimately, the data model is designed so that there is no
duplication of reportable records.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 95
31 May 2019
6.1.3 Protection
1 If there is protection securing the instrument, this is captured in the separate
2 protection entity.
3 The protection entity contains the information about all protection items (i.e. valuable
4 assets or rights) that are committed to the fulfilment of the terms of an instrument
5 (i.e. that secure the payments under a credit transaction), as specified in the (credit)
6 contract that gives rise to the instrument. All protection items in the protection entity
7 have an instrument identifier such that the protection item can be linked to the
8 instrument it secures.
9 When defining the data model, the possibility that the same protection item may be
10 associated with several instruments is taken into account. This could imply that a
11 protection item appears in the protection entity multiple times in relation to different
12 instruments. The same protection item would therefore appear in several entries,
13 with the protection entity relating to a different instrument in each information triple
14 (of instrument, protection and counterparty). This nevertheless involves no repetition
15 of the protection information across different instruments (e.g. the allocated amount
16 specific to each instrument).
17 Protection always involves at least one counterparty – the protection provider. The
18 counterparty which grants the protection is identified and reported to AnaCredit (unless
19 it is a natural person). The counterparty is described in the counterparty entity.
20 In the context of AnaCredit, the protection value (and consequently also the allocated
21 protection value) is reported gross of any haircut (i.e. before any haircut is applied).
6.1.4 Counterparty
22 An instrument always involves counterparties. The counterparties are described in
23 the counterparty entity.
24 The counterparty entity contains information about counterparties related to the
25 instrument entity and, if relevant, to the protection entity. The counterparty entity also
26 contains information about certain counterparties affiliated with debtors and
27 protection providers of an instrument in the instrument entity.
28 In a similar way to the modelling of the instrument and protection entities, the
29 modelling of the counterparty entity takes into account the fact that the same
30 counterparty may relate to several instruments and protection items.
31 For the purpose of AnaCredit, all counterparties which take any of the following roles
32 are reflected in the counterparty entity:
33 1. the creditor of the instrument;
34 2. the originator of the instrument, if the instrument is a securitisation
35 transaction;
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 96
31 May 2019
1 3. the servicer of the instrument;
2 4. the debtor of the instrument;
3 5. the protection provider that provides protection to the instrument (if any
4 protection item is provided);
5 6. the head office undertaking of (any foreign branch or a special fund19 that is)
6 a debtor of the instrument or a protection provider that provides protection to
7 the instrument;
8 7. the immediate parent undertaking of any debtor of the instrument, or of any
9 protection provider that provides protection to the instrument;
10 8. the ultimate parent undertaking of any debtor of the instrument, or of any
11 protection provider that provides protection to the instrument.
12 On any given date, a counterparty may assume one or more of these roles in relation
13 to one or more instruments. Similarly, a single role may be assumed by many
14 counterparties on any given date.
15 No natural persons in the If a natural person is a counterparty in any of the eight roles mentioned above, then

6.1.5 Conceptual representation – the observed agent’s perspective
18 Revision mark: this paragraph is Given the distinct data entities of a credit and taking the perspective of an observed
adjusted to align with the
19 agent, AnaCredit’s conceptual representation of credit consists of a set of fact
perspective taken in Chart 14
20 schemata that basically model facts, measures, dimensions, and hierarchies21 with
21 reference to credit vis-à-vis the credit institution.
22 The AnaCredit conceptual data model establishes a broad view of what should be
23 considered in the AnaCredit reporting, as the data model includes the distinct data
24 entities and the relationships between them. However, the conceptual data model
25 specifies neither data attributes nor primary keys. Yet, choosing a conceptual data
26 model means that dimensions, measures and the granularity of data have been
27 defined.
19 Please refer to Section 3.1 for details regarding special funds.
20 Reporting agents may use the same counterparty entity for managing the instruments as for
reporting to AnaCredit. In this case, the data on natural persons, although they are part of
counterparty data of the reporting agents, are not reported to AnaCredit.
21 In data modelling theory a “fact” is a concept that models a set of events (e.g. credit held or
serviced by a bank). In essence, a fact has dynamic properties or evolves in some way over
time. A “measure” is a numerical property of a fact and describes a quantitative fact aspect that
is relevant to analysis. For example, every credit is quantified at a given moment in time by its
nominal outstanding amount. A “qualitative dimension” (or data attribute) is a fact property with a
finite “domain” (i.e. a set of potential values) and describes an analysis coordinate of the fact.
The dimensions for the credit fact are type of credit, currency, dates, etc. Finally, “hierarchy”
determines how fact instances may be aggregated and selected, and determines the granularity
adopted for representing facts.

1 On any given reporting reference date (e.g. month-end):
2 • the instrument entity;
3 • the protection entity;
4 • the counterparty entity
5 are distinguished for each and every credit held or serviced by an observed agent,
6 and there is a contract under which the instrument arises.
7 This means that on a given reporting reference date, a set of fact aspects referring to
8 the credit is distinguished for each data entity. For instance, there is always a
9 creditor, a debtor and a servicer related to the instrument, which may also be
10 secured by a protection item.
11 In more detail, and taking the perspective of an observed agent, the conceptual data
12 model implies that, for the purpose of AnaCredit reporting, the following applies on a
13 given reporting reference date:
14 • a (credit) contract gives rise to one or more instruments;
15 • an instrument is part of one contract;
16 • an instrument has one or more creditors;
17 • an instrument has one or more debtors;
18 • an instrument has one or more servicers;
19 • an instrument has zero (i.e. there are none), one or more originators;
20 • an instrument is secured by zero (i.e. it is unsecured), one or more protection
21 items;
22 • a protection item secures one or more instruments;
23 • a protection item is provided by one or more counterparties;
24 • a counterparty services zero (i.e. it is not a servicer of any), one or more
25 instruments;
26 • a counterparty originates zero (i.e. it is not an originator of any), one or more
27 instruments;
28 • a counterparty is a debtor of zero (i.e. it is not a debtor of any), one or more
29 instruments;
30 • a counterparty is a creditor of zero (i.e. it is not a creditor of any), one or more
31 instruments;
32 • a counterparty is a provider of zero (i.e. it is not a provider of any protection
33 item), one or more protection items;
34 • a counterparty is the head office undertaking of zero (i.e. it is not the head office
35 undertaking of any), one or more counterparties;
36 • a counterparty has zero (i.e. it does not have any) or one head office
37 undertaking;
38 • a counterparty is the immediate parent undertaking of zero (i.e. it is not the
39 immediate parent undertaking of any), one or more counterparties;
40 • a counterparty has zero (i.e. it does not have any) or one immediate parent
41 undertaking;
42 • a counterparty is the ultimate parent undertaking of zero (i.e. it is not the
43 ultimate parent undertaking of any), one or more counterparties;
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 100
31 May 2019
1 • a counterparty has zero (i.e. it does not have any) or one ultimate parent
2 undertaking.
3 As regards the number of occurrences of the same piece of information, the
4 AnaCredit data model implies that on a given reporting reference date:
(i) an instrument has a single set of values describing it;
(ii) a protection item has a single set of values describing it;
(iii) a counterparty has a single set of values describing it.
5 In addition, on a given reporting reference date an observed agent holds or services
6 zero (i.e. it holds or services no instruments), one or more instruments.
7 The instrument entity is the centrepiece of the AnaCredit data model, which implies
8 that if the observed agent does not hold or service any instruments that are
9 reportable to AnaCredit then all the other data entities (i.e. the counterparty and
10 protection entities) become irrelevant.
11 Importantly, the relationships between the data entities distinguished in the
12 conceptual model are generally many-to-many.22
13 This conceptual data model is used as the foundation for the AnaCredit logical data
14 model.
6.2 Logical data model – the reporting agent’s perspective
15 Revision mark: this paragraph is The logical data model contains more details than the AnaCredit conceptual data
enhanced with further clarifications
16 model. In particular, the logical data model:
17 • includes all entity tables (i.e. distinct parts in which the data are grouped on the
18 basis of its nature) and relationships between them;
19 • specifies data attributes (i.e. individual characteristics that describe the facts
20 recorded) for each data entity;
21 • specifies a primary key for each data entity (i.e. one or a combination of
22 identifiers – identifying data attributes – that uniquely identifies a record in a
23 data entity);
24 • specifies foreign keys (i.e. one or combination of identifiers – identifying data
25 attributes – which allow the relationship between different data entities to be
26 identified.
27 The logical data model also involves normalisation, which is the process of removing
28 redundancy in an entity table. Normalisation typically occurs by dividing an entity
29 table into two or more and defining relationships between the tables. Consequently,
22 A many-to-many relationship is a type of cardinality that refers to the relationship between two
entities A and B in which A may contain one record related to several records in B and vice
versa. For instance, an instrument is secured by many protection items and one protection item
secures many instruments.

1 the AnaCredit logical data model comprises more explicit data entities than the
2 conceptual data model. This is motivated by the replacement of any many-to-many
3 relationships in the conceptual model with one-to-many relationships23, which is
4 achieved by introducing bridging tables.
5 The AnaCredit logical data model from the reporting agent’s perspective is depicted
6 in Chart 15 (as opposed to Chart 14 above, which shows the observed agent’s
7 perspective). This means that the observed agent is not fixed and is therefore
8 incorporated into the entity relationship diagram.
9 The reference date is fixed in the entity relationship diagram, meaning that all the
10 data therein are valid as of the reference date.
11 The AnaCredit logical data model is presented from the reporting agent’s perspective
12 because of the requirement (Point 1.2 of Annex I of the AnaCredit Regulation) to
13 uniquely identify the counterparty at the level of the reporting agent (see also the
14 definition of the counterparty identifier in Annex IV of the AnaCredit Regulation).
23 A one-to-many relationship exists when one instance in table A may be linked with many
instances in table B, but one instance in table B is linked to only one instance in table A. It is
important to note that a one-to-many relationship is not a property of the data, but rather of the
relationship itself.

4 To start with, a distinction is made between:
5 1. the instrument entity table;
6 2. the protection entity table;
7 3. the instrument-protection received entity table.
8 The instrument-protection received entity table bridges the instrument entity table
9 and the protection entity table, where the many-to-many relationships between the
10 instrument and protection entities in the conceptual data model are modelled with a
11 series of one-to-many relations.
12 The counterparty entity as referred to in the conceptual data model is also split into
13 two tables in the logical data model, namely:
14 4. the counterparty reference data entity table;
15 5. the counterparty risk/default entity table.
16 Finally, the counterparty entity and the instrument entity of the conceptual data
17 model are bridged by a series of one-to-many relationships, which is achieved by
18 incorporating the following into the logical data model:
19 6. the counterparty-instrument entity table.
20 Each of the six entity tables consists of records. A record is an individual row in one
21 table, uniquely identified by the data attributes marked as primary keys (PK).
22 The contract does not carry any In the logical data model, the contract (which is a separate data entity in the
data attributes that would describe
23 conceptual data model) is a primary key of the instrument and appears in all these
the contract separately
24 entity tables wherever the instrument occurs. Any relevant contract information is
25 captured at the level of the instrument, which is uniquely linked to a contract (for
26 example, the date on which the contract became binding for all parties).
6.2.1 Identifiers used across the entity tables
27 Revision mark: further In addition to the data attributes (that record features of the three data entities of
clarifications are added to this
28 credit), each entity table includes a number of internal identifiers. These identifiers
paragraph
29 are a key part of the data model and have no meaning outside of AnaCredit. They
30 ensure that each record or entry can be (uniquely) identified by one or a combination
31 of identifiers in an entity table. They help to maintain data integrity and to identify the
32 relationship between the datasets. These internal identifiers are:
33 1. observed agent identifier;

keys are added in this section
10 The primary key is a combination of one or more identifiers that uniquely identifies
11 one occurrence in an entity table. The primary key is a combination of the identifiers
12 listed in Section 6.2.1.
13 From the reporting agent’s perspective, the following combinations of identifiers are
14 the primary key of the different entity tables:
1. instrument entity table:
15 • observed agent identifier;
16 • contract identifier;
17 • instrument identifier.
2. instrument-protection received entity table:
18 • observed agent identifier;
19 • contract identifier;
20 • instrument identifier;
21 • protection identifier.
3. protection received entity table:24
24 Please note that unless protection is granted by a natural person, each protection item reported
in the protection received entity table should be reported along with the protection provider
identifier. However, the protection provider identifier does not account for the primary key.
Moreover, any protection item is only reported once in the protection received entity, although
some protection items may be actually provided by several protection providers (for example,
joint guarantors).

10 • counterparty identifier.
11 Please note that from the reporting agent’s perspective, the counterparty reference
12 data entity table is uniquely identified by the counterparty identifier. This is because
13 the counterparty identifier is uniquely assigned to a counterparty at the level of the
14 observed agent’s legal entity (i.e. the credit institution).
15 Ultimately, the counterparty will be Please note that the counterparty will ultimately be uniquely identified at European

17 be used in AnaCredit European level cannot be the sole responsibility of a reporting agent and will be
18 primarily carried out by the NCBs. Some countries have an existing Central Credit
19 Register and a process for identifying counterparties already in place. This implies
20 the existence of a unique counterparty identifier at national level (cf. Section 12.4.1
21 in Part II of the Manual).
22 The primary keys (abbreviated as PK) for each entity table are specified in Chart 15:
23 AnaCredit logical data model – the reporting agent’s perspective in Section 6.2 (and
24 in Chart 16: AnaCredit logical data model and reportable datasets – the reporting
25 agent’s perspective in Section 6.3).
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 106

Example 26: Counterparty identifier unique for the reporting agent
The reporting agent RA0 (a credit institution) reports for its two observed agents:
RA0_OA1 (the domestic part of the credit institution) and RA0_OA2 (a foreign branch of
the credit institution).
The observed agent RA0_OA1 holds an instrument in which client C is a debtor. The
observed agent RA0_OA1 uses the counterparty identifier Client_123 to uniquely
identify client C.
Similarly, the observed agent RA0_OA2 holds two instruments in which client C is a
debtor. However, the observed agent RA0_OA2 uses the counterparty identifier
Cpty_9867 to uniquely identify client C.
The reporting agent RA0 recognises that the counterparty identifiers Client_123 used by
the observed agent RA0_OA1 and the counterparty identifier Cpty_9867 used by the
observed agent RA0_OA2 both refer to the same client C.
Subsequently, to comply with the primary key definition of the counterparty reference
data entity table, the reporting agent RA0 assigns a unique counterparty identifier
Client_123_Cpty_9867 to Client C and uses this counterparty identifier to substitute the
different counterparty identifiers used in relation to the same client C in all the respective
entity tables of the two observed agents.
6.2.1.2 Foreign keys for each entity table
1 Foreign keys identify the relationships between the different entities. In particular, a
2 foreign key is one or more identifiers in one entity table that uniquely identifies a row
3 of another entity table. In other words, a foreign key is defined in the second entity
4 table but refers to the primary key in the first table.
5 For example, the combination (observed agent identifier, contract identifier,
6 instrument identifier) is a foreign key in the instrument-protection received entity
7 table that refers to the primary key in the instrument entity table. The combination
8 (observed agent identifier, protection identifier) in the instrument-protection received
9 entity table refers to the primary key in the protection entity table.
10 The foreign keys for each entity table are specified in Chart 15: AnaCredit logical
11 data model – the reporting agent’s perspective at the beginning of Section 6.2 (and
12 in Chart 16: AnaCredit logical data model and reportable datasets – the reporting
13 agent’s perspective in Section 6.3), where they are abbreviated as FK in the
14 respective entity tables.
6.2.2 Entity tables of the logical data model
15 The logical data model specifies data attributes for each entity table. A data attribute
16 is an individual characteristic to be collected and registered in a given entity table

2 some data attributes are reported monthly, while others are reported quarterly).
3 Please refer to section 6.3 for more details. To achieve a high level of consistency
4 and data quality, all the data attributes are required to be compiled taking the
5 following principles into account:
6 • all the data attributes are valid as of the same date.
7 On any given reference date, a data attribute represents a specific feature that is
8 valid or regarded as valid as of that reference date. All data attributes are valid as of
9 the same reference date – i.e. they represent specific features at the same moment
10 in time.
11 • all the data attributes of the same table are defined on the same level of
12 granularity.
13 All data attributes in the same entity table relate to the same element and are
14 defined on the same level of granularity (i.e. the level corresponding to a single row
15 in a given entity table).
16 The data attributes to be compiled and collected in each entity table are listed below.
17 The definitions of the fields are provided in Part II of this Manual.
6.2.2.1 The instrument entity table
6.2.2.1.1 Definition of the instrument entity table
18 The instrument entity table is the centrepiece of the data model. This means that all
19 other entity tables relate directly or indirectly to the instrument entity table. The
20 instrument entity table collects specific information that describes the instrument,
21 such as the basic features of the instrument, the financial aspects of the instrument
22 and the accounting features of the instrument.
6.2.2.1.2 Description
23 The data in the instrument entity table describe both features of the instrument which
24 change rarely over time and features which reflect the instrument’s financial
25 development in accordance with the relevant accounting standard. Such features are
26 captured via respective data attributes which are required to describe the instrument
27 as of the same reference date. This means that any information collected is accurate
28 as of a given reference date. Any relevant dependencies between the data attributes
29 are also reflected accordingly.
30 Example 27 provides a representation of certain features of an instrument (a loan)
31 over time, with a focus on the relationship between the features.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 108
31 May 2019
Example 27: Selected information in the instrument entity table
A loan (credit) is represented by an instrument. The outstanding amount of the loan is
€10,000.
The instrument becomes non-performing as of 16 September. As of 20 October, the
loan is fully provisioned (i.e. an impairment loss is recognised), and as of 26 November
the loan is written-off.
The following table provides an overview of the selected features of the instrument and
how they evolve over time, taking into account the mutual dependencies between the
features, and following the events prescribed (leaving aside the fact that the data
attributes “accumulated impairment amount”, “performing status of the instrument” and
“accumulated write-offs” are not required for non-quarter-end dates).
Outstanding Accumulated
Instrument nominal impairment Performing status Accumulated
Date ID amount amount of the instrument write-offs
31/08/2019 Instrument 1 10,000.00 0.00 Performing 0.00
30/09/2019 Instrument 1 10,000.00 0.00 Non-performing 0.00
31/10/2019 Instrument 1 10,000.00 10,000.00 Non-performing 0.00
30/11/2019 Instrument 1 0.00 0.00 Non-performing 10,000.00
Notably, the write-off in November results in:
• the outstanding nominal amount being reduced to €0, as following the accounting
rules the write-off leads to the derecognition of the loan from the balance sheet;
• the accumulated impairment amount being reduced to €0, as this amount
corresponds exactly to the outstanding debt of the loan.
Please note that this example only illustrates the logic within the instrument entity table.
It does not indicate what and at which point in time is actually reported to AnaCredit.
1 More details on how the attributes interrelate with one another are provided in the
2 respective sections of Part II of this Manual, where the data attributes are specifically
3 discussed.
6.2.2.1.3 Record
4 For each instrument identified and registered in the respective datasets, the instrument
5 entity table contains a record, i.e. a single set of data, describing the instrument. The
6 information is provided for all instruments that are required to be reported. The criteria
7 triggering the reporting of instruments are presented in Section 5.

counterparty-instrument entity table
10 There is a relationship between the instrument entity table and the counterparty-
11 instrument entity table:
12 • One record in the instrument entity table links with at least three records in the
13 counterparty-instrument table (where it is registered along with the
14 counterparties assuming the roles of creditor, debtor and servicer).
15 • One record in the counterparty-instrument entity table links with one record in
16 the instrument entity table.
Example 28: Relationships between counterparties and instruments
One counterparty may act as both creditor and servicer, while a different counterparty
acts as debtor. In this case, there are still three records (for the creditor, servicer and
debtor) in the counterparty-instrument entity table, all linked to the same instrument.
Conversely, several different counterparties may be linked with a single instrument if
there are, for instance, several debtors in relation to a single instrument. Each of these
relationships requires a separate record in the counterparty-instrument entity table.
17 Any instrument registered in the instrument-protection received entity table is
18 registered in the instrument entity table.
19 There is a relationship between the instrument entity table and the instrument-
20 protection received entity table:
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 110
31 May 2019
1 • One record in the instrument entity table links with zero, one or more records in
2 the instrument-protection received entity table (one record for each protection
3 item securing the instrument).
4 • One record in the instrument-protection received entity table links with one
5 record in the instrument entity table.
Example 29: Relationships between instruments and protection
If an instrument is unsecured, there is no record for this instrument in the instrument-
protection received entity table.
Conversely, if an instrument is secured by several different protection items, there are
as many records for this instrument in the instrument-protection received entity table as
there are protection items securing the instrument.

6.2.2.2 The counterparty-instrument entity table
6.2.2.2.1 Definition of the counterparty-instrument entity table
4 The counterparty-instrument entity table is the set of all combinations of instruments
5 reported pursuant to Articles 4 and 5 within the scope of the reporting agent and
6 related counterparties which assume any of the roles of creditor, servicer, debtor
7 and, if applicable, originator vis-à-vis the instrument.
6.2.2.2.2 Description
8 The relationships between counterparties to the instrument are registered in the
9 counterparty-instrument entity table, which includes the counterparties directly
10 involved in the instrument and their respective roles vis-à-vis the instrument.
11 Specifically, the entity table registers all (non-natural person) counterparties which
12 take the role of:
13 • debtor of the instrument;
14 • creditor of the instrument;
15 • servicer of the instrument.
16 Under certain circumstances, registration also includes counterparties which take the
17 role of:
18 • originator to the instrument (if the instrument is a securitisation transaction)
Joint liability amount only for
19 counterparties acting as debtors The counterparty-instrument entity table supports the registration of the joint liability

1 In particular, instruments relating to multiple debtors generally appear multiple times
2 in the counterparty-instrument entity table. Therefore, there is generally a repetition
3 of the instrument identifier and debtor counterparty role, associated with different
4 counterparties, for as many different debtors as the instrument possesses. The joint
5 liability information is provided individually for each record, and is never aggregated
6 across debtors.

should be registered in the
counterparty reference data entity
9 table No records are made in the counterparty-instrument entity table for a given
10 instrument if all the counterparties to the instrument are natural persons.
11 Example 30 illustrates the contents of the counterparty-instrument entity table in the
12 case of an instrument granted to both a legal entity and a natural person, where both
13 debtors are partially liable.
Example 30: Instrument granted to a legal entity and a natural person (partial
liability)
As of 30 September, the reporting agent RA_1 reports data of the observed agent
RA1_OA1 following the logical data model.
The counterparty Legal entity A and the counterparty Natural person are both partially
liable for the instrument Instrument_A_1 registered in the instrument entity table. Both
counterparties are partially (and equally) liable for making repayments of
Instrument_A_1, i.e. each of them is liable for 50% of the instrument. The outstanding
nominal amount registered in the instrument entity table is €100,000. The partial liability
of each counterparty is 50%.
Date Instrument ID Outstanding nominal amount
30/09/2019 Instrument_A_1 100,000.00
Regarding the counterparty-instrument entity table, the following is registered:
Date Instrument ID Counterparty ID Counterparty role Joint liability amount
30/09/2019 Instrument_A_1 Legal entity A Debtor 50,000.00
30/09/2019 Instrument_A_1 RA1_OA1 Creditor n/a
30/09/2019 Instrument_A_1 RA1_OA1 Servicer n/a
In this case, only the counterparty Legal entity A is registered in the
counterparty-instrument entity with its role as debtor and the corresponding liability
amount of €50,000.
No entry at all is made for the other debtor – counterparty Natural person – in the
counterparty-instrument entity table.
14 By contrast, Example 31 illustrates the contents of the counterparty-instrument entity
15 table in the case of an instrument granted to two legal entities, where both debtors
16 are fully liable (i.e. each debtor is liable for 100% of the outstanding debt).
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 114
31 May 2019
Example 31: Instrument granted to two legal entities, both fully liable for the
outstanding debt
As of 30 September, the reporting agent RA_1 reports data of the observed agent
RA1_OA1 following the logical data model.
The counterparty Legal entity A and the counterparty Legal entity B are both fully liable
for the instrument Instrument_A_1, registered in the instrument entity table. In other
words, each counterparty is liable for the total debt outstanding under the instrument –
as of 30 September the outstanding debt amounts to €100,000. The full liability of each
counterparty is 100%.
Date Instrument ID Outstanding nominal amount
30/09/2019 Instrument_A_1 100,000.00
In the counterparty-instrument entity table, the following data are registered:
Date Instrument ID Counterparty ID Counterparty role Joint liability amount
30/09/2019 Instrument_A_1 Legal entity A Debtor 100,000.00
30/09/2019 Instrument_A_1 Legal entity B Debtor 100,000.00
30/09/2019 Instrument_A_1 RA1_OA1 Servicer n/a
30/09/2019 Instrument_A_1 RA1_OA1 Creditor n/a
In this case, both the counterparty Legal entity A and the counterparty Legal entity B are
registered in the counterparty-instrument entity with their roles as (co-)debtor and the
corresponding liability amount of €100,000 each.

17 There is a relationship between the counterparty-instrument entity table and the
18 counterparty entity table:
19 • One record in the counterparty reference data entity table links with zero, one or
20 more records in the counterparty-instrument entity table.
21 • One record in the counterparty-instrument entity table links with one record in
22 the counterparty reference data entity table.
Example 32: Relationships between counterparties to instruments and the
counterparty entity
A counterparty which acts as both creditor and servicer of the same instrument is
recorded in the counterparty-instrument entity table in two different records. This means
that two records also link with this counterparty in the counterparty reference data entity
table.
A counterparty (a protection provider) may grant protection securing an instrument
without assuming any of the roles of creditor, servicer, debtor or originator in relation to
the instrument. In this case, the protection provider is not reported in the counterparty-
instrument entity table. However, every protection provider which is not a natural person
is registered in the counterparty reference data entity table.
23 There is a relationship between the counterparty-instrument entity table and the
24 instrument entity table:

1 • One record in the counterparty-instrument entity table links with exactly one
2 record in the instrument entity table.
3 • One record in the instrument entity table links with as many records in the
4 counterparty-instrument table as there are counterparties assuming any of the
5 roles of debtor, creditor, servicer, or originator to this instrument, double- (or
6 triple-) counting counterparties that assume multiple roles (e.g., creditor and
7 servicer) but excluding all counterparties that are natural persons. There are a
8 minimum of three records in the counterparty-instrument entity table for every
9 instrument detailing its relationships with creditor, servicer and debtor, none of
10 which may be a natural person. Please note that if all debtors are natural
11 persons the instrument is not subject to reporting requirements pursuant to
12 Articles 4 and 5 of the AnaCredit Regulation.
Example 33: Relationships between counterparties to instruments and instruments
If one instrument links with no more than two counterparties (one assuming the roles of
creditor and servicer, the other assuming the role of debtor), then there are three
different records in the counterparty-instrument entity table.
Conversely, there may be many debtors (other than natural persons) of a single
instrument, each of them requiring a separate record in the counterparty-instrument
entity table. The total number of possible records in the counterparty-instrument entity
table relating to a single instrument is thus driven by the number of different
counterparties involved in the instrument in any of the following roles: creditor, servicer,
debtor or originator.
13 The following example illustrates the above set of relationships between instruments
14 and counterparties.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 117
31 May 2019
Example 34: Relationships between the counterparty and the instrument
For a given credit, represented by an instrument, there is always at least one debtor of
the instrument. The debtor is registered in the counterparty-instrument entity table and
is associated with the debtor counterparty role therein.
Any counterparty (other than a natural person) registered in the counterparty-instrument
entity table is registered in the counterparty reference data entity table. In particular, for
any debtor of an instrument the relevant debtor information (name, address, etc.) is
registered in the counterparty reference data entity table.
In the case of natural persons involved in instruments, for AnaCredit purposes, no entry
is made in the counterparty-instrument entity table and consequently no record appears
in the counterparty reference data entity table.
A number of distinct counterparties registered in the counterparty reference data entity
table may be debtors of several distinct instruments or just one instrument (i.e. in the
case of joint debtors) registered in the instrument entity table.
If an instrument relates to multiple (non-natural person) debtors then this instrument is
registered in the counterparty-instrument entity table multiple times. There is therefore a
repetition of the instrument identifier and other instrument information in multiple
separate entries with different debtor identifiers.
Some counterparties registered in the counterparty reference data entity table may not
be directly linked with any instrument registered in the instrument entity table.
Specifically, a counterparty that is a protection provider (e.g. a guarantor) is not linked to
any instrument in the counterparty-instrument entity table. Similarly, the head office
undertaking of a counterparty that is a debtor of an instrument may not be directly linked
to any instrument in the instrument entity table. Therefore, no such counterparty is
registered in the counterparty-instrument entity table.

6.2.2.3.1 Definition of the instrument-protection received entity table
4 The instrument-protection received entity table is the set of all combinations of
5 instruments reported pursuant to Articles 4 and 5 of the AnaCredit Regulation within
6 the scope of the reporting agent and the related protection items which secure the
7 instrument. It follows that, while all protection items in the protection received entity
8 table secure at least one instrument in the instrument entity table and hence appear
9 in the instrument-protection received entity table, instruments which are unsecured
10 do not appear in the instrument-protection received entity table.
6.2.2.3.2 Description
11 Instruments that are secured by protection are registered in the instrument-protection

21 protection items that are committed, under the (credit) contract, to fulfilment of the
items, even those provided by
22 natural persons terms of an instrument registered in the instrument entity table, including those
23 where the protection provider is a natural person. All protection items in the
24 instrument-protection received entity table are connected to the instrument that they
25 secure via the instrument identifier of the instrument that they secure.
26 If a protection item is used to secure several instruments, the protection identifier of
27 this protection item is registered in the instrument-protection received entity table
28 multiple times. This means that the protection identifier is repeated across records
29 for each instrument identifier of the instruments that are secured by this protection
30 item. However, the allocated amount (protection allocated value) is specific to the
31 instrument. In addition, on any given reference date, the sum of the protection

1 allocated values across all the instruments that the protection secures should in
2 general not exceed the protection value registered in the protection entity table.
3 Conversely, if an instrument is secured by several protection items, the instrument
4 identifier of the instrument is registered in the instrument-protection received entity
5 table multiple times. This means that the instrument identifier is repeated across
6 records for each protection identifier of the protection items that secure this
7 instrument.
6.2.2.3.3 Record
8 For each instrument identified and registered in the respective datasets, there are as
9 many records in the instrument-protection received entity table as there are

there are protection items securing the instrument.

27 Counterparty risk/default information should generally be available in relation to all protection

1 • reporting agent identifier;
2 • observed agent identifier;

4 Please note that the level of granularity does not include the protection provider
5 identifier. This is because the AnaCredit data model assumes that there is only one
6 protection provider for any protection item. However, protection may actually be
7 provided by several protection providers (for example, joint guarantors providing a
8 financial guarantee). Special treatment is therefore required if there are several
9 protection providers for the same protection item.
10 Specifically, although reporting agents identify all protection providers of any
11 protection item in their systems (e.g. by maintaining a relationship table between
12 protection items and their protection providers in line with the
13 counterparty-instrument dataset), only one of several protection providers is
14 technically reported to AnaCredit. The AnaCredit Regulation does not specify any

9 providers record in the counterparty reference data entity table.
10 • For each observed agent, one record in the counterparty reference data entity
11 table links with zero or one record in the counterparty risk/default entity table.
Example 39: Relationships between counterparty reference data and counterparty
risk/default
If a counterparty in the counterparty reference data entity table does not act as debtor
or provider (and issuer) of protection in the form of unfunded credit protection as defined
in Article 4(1)(59) of the CRR (such as a financial guarantee, cf. Section 6.2.2.4.2) in
relation to any instrument of the observed agent reported under AnaCredit, this
counterparty does not link to any record in the counterparty risk/default entity table.
If a counterparty in the counterparty reference data entity table acts as debtor in the
counterparty-instrument dataset to several instruments that relate to the same observed
agent, the counterparty is reported only once in the counterparty risk/default entity table.
If a counterparty in the counterparty reference data entity table acts as debtor or
provider (and issuer) of unfunded protection to several instruments held by different
observed agents within the scope of the same reporting agent, then the counterparty is
reported in the counterparty risk/default entity table relating to each of the observed
agents which hold any instrument in relation to which this counterparty is a debtor or for
which the counterparty provides a financial guarantee. In particular, the PD and default
status of the counterparty that are reported in relation to this counterparty are identical
across different observed agents of one reporting agent.
For counterparties registered in the counterparty risk/default entity table, relevant
counterparty information is registered in the counterparty reference data entity table.
Immediate and ultimate parent undertakings of a debtor (or a protection provider which
is also the protection issuer) of an instrument are also registered in the counterparty
reference data entity table. However, immediate and ultimate parent undertakings do
not need to be debtors of any instrument registered in the instrument entity table or
protection providers. Immediate and ultimate parent undertakings thus do not need to
be registered in the counterparty risk/default entity table.
6.2.2.5.6 Data attributes
The counterparty risk/default entity table comprises the following data attributes:

4 The counterparty risk / default entity table corresponds to dataset 9 (counterparty
5 risk data) and dataset 10 (counterparty default data) in Template 2 of Annex I to the
6 AnaCredit Regulation.
6.2.2.6 The counterparty reference data entity table
6.2.2.6.1 Definition of the counterparty reference data entity table
7 The counterparty reference data entity table is the set of all institutional units which
8 are linked to instruments reported pursuant to Articles 4 and Article 5 of the
9 AnaCredit Regulation or provide protection to secure such, or are affiliated with
10 debtors or protection providers (AnaCredit Regulation, Annex I, Template 1, 1.3).
11 Each counterparty registered in the counterparty reference data entity table is
12 uniquely identified at the level of the observed agent’s legal entity (the credit
13 institution). This requirement is discussed in more detail in Section 3.1. No data on
14 natural persons are required in the counterparty reference data entity table.
6.2.2.6.2 Description
Specifically, the counterparties to be registered are:
(a) creditors;
(b) debtors;
(c) protection providers;
(d) originators;
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 129
31 May 2019
(e) servicers;
1 The following counterparties affiliated with debtors or protection providers are also
2 registered in the counterparty reference data entity table:
(f) head office undertakings;
(g) immediate parent undertakings;
(h) ultimate parent undertakings.
3 However, additional conditions apply for head office undertakings, immediate parent
4 undertakings and ultimate parent undertakings. These conditions are:
5 • the head office undertaking of (a foreign branch or a special fund)30 that is a
6 debtor of an instrument registered in the counterparty-instrument entity table or
7 a protection provider registered in the protection entity table;
8 • the immediate parent undertaking of a debtor of an instrument registered in the
9 counterparty-instrument entity table or a protection provider registered in the
10 protection entity table;
11 • the ultimate parent undertaking of a debtor of an instrument registered in the
12 counterparty-instrument entity table or a protection provider registered in the
13 protection entity table.
14 Please note that for each counterparty identifier reported in the following data
15 attributes “head office undertaking identifier”, “immediate parent undertaking
16 identifier” and “ultimate parent undertaking identifier”, there is a data record in the
17 counterparty reference data (i.e. dataset 1 in Annex I of the AnaCredit Regulation)
18 for each of the respective undertakings.
19 Please note that the counterparty identifier of a legal entity is at the same time the
20 counterparty identifier of the domestic part of the legal entity.
21 Please also note that the head office undertaking identifier, the immediate parent
22 identifier and the ultimate parent identifier are only required in the counterparty
23 reference data entity table for counterparties that are registered in the
24 counterparty-instrument entity table as debtor and counterparties that are registered
25 in the protection received entity table as protection providers.
26 The counterparty reference data entity table never includes data on counterparties
27 which are natural persons, even if such counterparties act as co-debtors (i.e. where
28 there is a plurality of debtors) of instruments registered in the instrument entity table
29 or as protection providers of any protection registered in the protection received

12 head office undertaking.
13 • One record of the counterparty reference data entity table can be the head
14 office undertaking for zero, one or more other records of the counterparty
15 reference data entity table.
Example 40: Relationships between foreign branch and head office undertaking
A resident foreign branch has one and only one head office undertaking
16 There is a relationship between records of the protection received entity table and
17 records of the counterparty reference data entity table:
18 • One record in the counterparty reference data entity table links with zero, one or
19 more records in the protection received entity table.
20 • Unless a protection provider is a natural person, one record in the protection
21 received entity table links with one record in the counterparty reference data
22 entity table; (there is no such link where protection providers are natural
23 persons).
Example 41: Relationships between protection and counterparty reference data
A counterparty can grant protection against a contractually agreed negative credit event
for zero, one or more instruments.
A protection item does not have a relationship with a record of the counterparty
reference data entity table if the protection item is provided by a natural person.
24 There is a relationship between the counterparty-instrument entity table and the
25 counterparty reference data entity table:
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 132

1 • One record in the counterparty reference data entity table links with zero, one or
2 more records in the counterparty-instrument entity table.
3 • One record in the counterparty-instrument entity table links with one record in
4 the counterparty reference data entity table.
Example 42: Relationships between counterparty-instrument and counterparty
reference data
A counterparty can grant protection against a contractually agreed negative credit event
for zero, one or more instruments, but this counterparty does not have any counterparty
role (neither debtor nor creditor nor servicer nor originator) in relation to any instrument.
A counterparty can play several roles for many instruments (debtor of a deposit; creditor
or originator of a loan; servicer) in relation to any instrument.
5 There is a relationship between the counterparty reference data entity table and the
6 counterparty risk/default entity table:
7 • One record in the counterparty risk/default entity table links with one record in
8 the counterparty reference data entity table.
9 • For a given observed agent, one record in the counterparty reference data

11 table.
Example 43: Relationships between counterparty reference data and counterparty
risk/default
A counterparty in the counterparty reference data entity table which does not assume
the role of the debtor in relation to any instrument of an observed agent or is not a
provider of protection in the form of a financial guarantee33 does not relate to any record

1 The counterparty reference data entity table corresponds to dataset 1 (counterparty

6.3 Reportable datasets and reporting timeliness
3 The actual datasets to be reported are derived from the entity tables of the AnaCredit
4 logical data model, taking into consideration different methods for reporting the data
5 to AnaCredit and various reporting frequencies.
6.3.1 Reportable datasets
6 On a general level, AnaCredit requires that reporting agents report granular credit,
7 protection and counterparty information on a regular basis. More specifically, three
8 types of reporting frequencies have been introduced in the AnaCredit Regulation:
9 monthly, quarterly and on change.
10 Different reporting methods and To start with, the actual number of datasets to report (i.e. reports) is ten (10). This is

AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 134
31 May 2019
1 In particular, the information contained in the instrument entity table of the logical
2 data model is actually divided into three (3) datasets solely for the purpose of
3 reporting the instrument information to AnaCredit:
4 1. the instrument dataset;
5 2. the financial dataset;
6 3. the accounting dataset.
7 The counterparty-instrument entity table is also divided into two (2) datasets:
8 4. the counterparty-instrument dataset;
9 5. the joint liability dataset.
10 The counterparty risk/default entity table is divided into two (2) datasets:
11 6. the counterparty risk dataset;
12 7. the counterparty default dataset.
13 Finally, the other three (3) entity tables of the logical data model are directly
14 translated into datasets. These are:
15 8. the instrument-protection received dataset;
16 9. the protection received dataset;
17 10. the counterparty reference data.
18 Since the ten distinct datasets are created by simply splitting the underlying entity
19 table into groups of data attributes contained therein, the level of granularity of these
20 ten datasets is the same as the level of granularity of the underlying entity table as
21 distinguished in the AnaCredit logical data model.
22 An overview of all ten of these datasets is provided in the logical data model chart
23 below. The origination of each of the datasets (i.e. a group of data attributes) is
24 indicated by colours. Groups of data attributes belonging to the same data entity are
25 defined on the same level and differ only in terms of the reporting frequency and
26 timelines applicable.
27 The split of the datasets into Template 1 and Template 2, as set out in Article 6 of
28 the AnaCredit Regulation, is also indicated in Chart 16. The following datasets are all
29 part of Template 1:
30 • the counterparty reference data;
31 • the instrument dataset and the financial dataset of the instrument entity table;
32 • the counterparty-instrument dataset and the joint liabilities dataset.
The remaining datasets belong to Template 2.

1 The timelines for reporting the respective reports are described in the following
2 section.
6.3.2 Reporting methods, frequencies and timeliness
3 In general, AnaCredit anticipates that all data describe a credit (i.e., instrument,
4 protection and counterparty) as of the last day of the month to which they relate (i.e.
5 the reporting reference date). However, AnaCredit provides for different reporting
6 methods and frequencies for different datasets.
7 AnaCredit distinguishes between two different reporting methods:
(a) regular, where all records are reported;
(b) on change, where only new or changed records are reported.
8 AnaCredit distinguishes between two different reporting frequencies: (i) monthly
9 frequency and (ii) quarterly frequency.

25 Records of a dataset (i.e. either all records or only new/changed records) with a

27 timelines relevant for reporting data relating to an observed agent.

29 initially submitted to AnaCredit (as all are considered new records) in relation to the
month
30 first reporting of data for 30 September 2018. Thereafter, AnaCredit is only informed
31 of changed or new records. In the event of a change, however, the relevant records
32 do not have to be reported to AnaCredit immediately but are only required by no later
33 than the earliest monthly transmission date.

1 Please note that a new record covers the situation where a new instrument is
2 originated by the observed agent or a protection item is added in the period between
3 two consecutive reporting reference dates.
4 Quarterly reporting, meanwhile, means that the respective records of a dataset (i.e.
5 all records) are submitted to AnaCredit every quarter pursuant to the timelines
6 relevant for reporting data relating to an observed agent.
7 Different timeliness applies for submission of datasets (all records including
8 new/changed records) depending on the residency status of the observed agent.
9 In particular, for resident observed agents:
10 • data reported monthly under Article 13(4) of the AnaCredit Regulation are
11 reported by NCBs to the ECB within 30 working days of the reporting reference
12 date (end of month) to which they refer;
13 • data reported quarterly under Article 13(5) of the AnaCredit Regulation are
14 reported by NCBs to the ECB within 15 working days of the remittance date
15 (defined in Article 3(1)(b) of Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No
16 680/2014 – hereinafter referred to as “the ITS”) following the reporting reference
17 date (end of month) to which they refer.
Revision mark: an explanation is
18 added regarding non-resident For non-resident observed agents (i.e. observed agents that are foreign branches
19 foreign branches not resident in a reporting Member State), the following timelines applies:
20 • data reported monthly under Article 13(6) of the AnaCredit Regulation are
21 reported by NCBs to the ECB within 35 working days of the reporting reference
22 date (end of month) to which they refer;
23 • data reported quarterly under Article 13(7) of the AnaCredit Regulation are
24 reported by NCBs to the ECB within 20 working days of the remittance date
25 (defined in Article 3(1)(b) of the ITS) following the reporting reference date (end
26 of month) to which they refer.
27 The exact timeliness depends on the number of ECB and NCBs public holidays in
28 the reference period concerned.
29 The counterparty reference data dataset is compiled at reporting agent level
30 (counterparties contained therein are unique at the level of the reporting agent) and
31 the specific timelines for observed agents do not generally apply. More specifically, if
32 the reporting agent reports the activity as creditor or servicer of both resident and
33 non-resident observed agents, the different timelines are aligned to ensure
34 uniqueness of the counterparty reference data at the reporting agent level. Any
35 changes in the counterparty reference data therefore are reported following the
36 timelines envisaged for resident observed agents.

Reporting all records means that the complete dataset (new, changed and unchanged
records) is sent monthly or quarterly to AnaCredit (as indicated in the “When to report”
column).
Reporting only new or changed means reporting only those records that are either new
records or have been changed (i.e. one or more data attributes of a record have
changed) with the result that the values provided previously are no longer valid.

affected or unaffected by the change) of the instrument dataset is reported by no later
than the 30th working day after the earliest reporting reference date on which the
change is in effect.
Since the relevant reference date for the change is 31 October 2019, the record is
reported to AnaCredit within 30 working days of the reporting reference date.

This example concerns the instrument dataset. A change in one data attribute (e.g.
payment frequency) is acknowledged by the reporting agent on 22 October 2019.
However, on 27 October 2019 the data attribute is changed again. These changes
relate to an instrument already reported to AnaCredit.
Given that only the latter change is in effect on the earliest reporting reference date (i.e.
31 October 2019), the former change (on 22 October 2019) is irrelevant and only the
change on 27 October is reported.
A complete record of the instrument dataset is reported to AnaCredit within 30 working
days of 31 October 2019.

This example concerns the instrument dataset. A change in one data attribute (e.g.

October 2019 a change is made in another data attribute of the instrument dataset (e.g.
repayment rights). These changes relate to an instrument already reported to
AnaCredit.
Since both changes are in effect as of 31 October 2019, the timeline for reporting both
changes is 30 working days after 31 October 2019.
A single complete record (i.e. all the data attributes in one row, whether affected and

Example 47: Reporting in the case of multiple changes in consecutive months
This example concerns the instrument dataset. A change in one data attribute of the
data (e.g. payment frequency) is acknowledged by the reporting agent on 22 October
2019. This data attribute is changed again on 3 November 2019. These changes relate
to an instrument already reported to AnaCredit.
Given that only the former change is in effect on the earliest reporting reference date
(i.e. 31 October 2019), while the latter change (on 3 November 2019) is only in effect on
30 November, the reporting timelines are as follows:
• The first change (on 22 October 2019) is reported within 30 working days of 31
October 2019.
• The second change (on 3 November 2019) is reported within 30 working days of 30
November 2019.
This means that a complete record (i.e. all the data attributes in one row) of the
instrument dataset is reported to AnaCredit within 30 working days of 31 October 2019
(for the change on 22 October 2019).
Another complete record of the instrument dataset is reported to AnaCredit within 30
working days of 30 November 2019 (for the change on 3 November 2019)

7 Article 7 and reduced data requirements
1 Pursuant to Article 6(1) of the AnaCredit Regulation, reporting agents report to
2 AnaCredit all data attributes listed in the templates in Annex I of the AnaCredit
3 Regulation.
4 Reduced data requirements under However, as stipulated in Article 7, the reporting requirements may be reduced in
Annexes II and III
5 certain specific cases. These cases are described in Annex II and III of the
6 AnaCredit Regulation.
7 In fact, the AnaCredit Regulation distinguishes between:
8 • specific cases in relation to counterparty reference data;
9 • specific cases in relation to the remaining data attributes.
10 Annex III deals with reduced requirements for counterparty reference data, while
11 Annex II outlines reduced requirements for the remaining datasets.
12 In other words, the AnaCredit Regulation essentially requires that whenever an
13 instrument is reported to AnaCredit, reporting agents submit all the data attributes
14 listed in Annex I thereof. However, exemptions may apply in relation to certain data
15 attributes and under certain conditions.
16 General exemptions versus national Accordingly, the AnaCredit Regulation contains a classification of the specific
exemptions
17 circumstances under which a certain data attribute may not be required. A distinction
18 is made between the following:
(a) circumstances under which individual reporting agents may be exempted
from reporting certain data attributes by the relevant NCB;
(b) circumstances under which reporting agents are not required to report
certain data attributes at all.
19 Specific data attributes whose collection is at NCBs’ discretion (case (a) above) are
20 marked as “N” in Annex II and Annex III of the AnaCredit Regulation. Data attributes
21 that are not required to be reported (case (b) above) are marked as “X” in Annex II
22 and Annex III of the AnaCredit Regulation.
23 Required versus not required All data attributes that are not marked as either “N” or “X” in Annex II or Annex III of
24 the AnaCredit Regulation are required to be reported, in other words reporting
25 agents are obliged to report the actual value for such data attributes as of the
26 reporting reference date, where the actual value provides information about the
27 respective feature as of the reporting reference date to which it refers.
28 Revision mark: a reference to For information regarding the reporting of data attributes which are not (or may not

29 be, at NCBs’ discretion) required or which do not apply under certain circumstances,

30 values please refer to Section 2.2 in Part II of the Manual which deals specifically with
31 special reporting values.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 143
31 May 2019
7.1 General rules regarding data attributes marked as “X”
1 “X” data attributes are not Under the specified circumstances, the collection of any data attribute marked as “X”
mandatory
2 in Annex II or Annex III is not mandatory.
3 This means that reporting agents are not required to report the actual value for these
4 data attributes to AnaCredit in the specified situation.
5 The exemption from reporting certain data attributes to AnaCredit is nevertheless
6 without prejudice to national requirements. As NCBs may, on the basis of national
7 regulations, extend reporting obligations beyond the scope defined in the AnaCredit
8 Regulation, reporting agents in a given country may in fact be required to report
9 some or all of the data attributes marked as “X”. Such data attributes are also
10 transmitted to AnaCredit.
11 If reporting agents choose to report the data attributes not required by the AnaCredit
12 Regulation (i.e. they report the actual values for these data attributes), they are
13 collected by NCBs and transmitted to AnaCredit and are subject to the minimum
14 standards for transmission, accuracy, compliance with concepts and revisions
15 specified in Annex V of the AnaCredit Regulation.
7.2 General rules regarding data attributes marked as “N”
16 “N” data attributes are mandatory Under the specified circumstances, the collection of any data attribute marked as “N”
unless indicated otherwise by the
17 in Annex II or Annex III is mandatory unless decided otherwise by the relevant NCB.
relevant NCB
18 More specifically, NCBs have the right to exempt reporting agents from reporting
19 certain data attributes to AnaCredit under certain specified circumstances.
20 This means that if special conditions apply, the relevant NCB may decide not to
21 require reporting agents to report certain data attributes. Effectively, the reporting of
22 such data attributes is not mandatory under the specified circumstances and
23 reporting agents do not have to report the actual value for these data attributes.
24 Although the specific right of NCBs is deemed to be primarily applicable to individual
25 (or groups of) reporting agents (in cases where a given reporting agent temporarily
26 faces difficulties in obtaining the data), it may also be applied to the reporting
27 population as a whole if the relevant NCB considers that these difficulties exist
28 generally.
7.3 Reduced requirements for counterparty reference data –
the most onerous reporting requirement
29 Tables 2 and 3 of Annex III of the AnaCredit Regulation specify the reporting
30 requirements for each data attribute in the counterparty reference data described in
31 Template 1 of Annex I.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 144
31 May 2019
1 Table 2 specifies the requirements for counterparties resident in a reporting Member
2 State while Table 3 specifies the requirements for counterparties not resident in a
3 reporting Member State.
4 The level of application is the The requirements for counterparty reference data apply at the level of the reporting
reporting agent
5 agent; this is implied by the fact that counterparties are uniquely identified and
6 registered at the level of the reporting agent (i.e. the observed agent’s legal entity, cf.
7 Section 3.1).
8 In line with the AnaCredit data model, and as also described in Chapter 3, a single
9 counterparty may be involved in several instruments or take on different roles as a
10 counterparty for the same instrument. However, each counterparty is registered only
11 once in the counterparty reference data without specifying which roles the
12 counterparty takes on or which observed agent the counterparty actually originates
13 from.
14 In particular, any counterparty affiliated with instruments reported to AnaCredit may
15 take on one or more of the following roles:
16 • reporting agent;
17 • observed agent;
18 • creditor;
19 • debtor;
20 • servicer;
21 • originator;
22 • protection provider;
23 • head office undertaking (of a foreign branch or a special fund that is a debtor or
24 protection provider);
25 • immediate parent undertaking (of a debtor or protection provider);
26 • ultimate parent undertaking (of a debtor or protection provider).
Reporting agent reports only one
27 record in the counterparty reference The counterparty reference data reported to AnaCredit by a reporting agent contain
28 data for each counterparty only one record for each counterparty as of a given reporting reference date
29 irrespective of how many observed agents (of the reporting agent) effectively relate
30 to the given counterparty and regardless of how many roles the counterparty takes
31 on across the related observed agents. Irrespective of which role or roles a
32 counterparty takes on, the reporting agent reports a single record relating to the
33 counterparty in the counterparty reference data.

adjustments are applied to this
paragraph
12 In fact, the AnaCredit Regulation stipulates that if a counterparty to be registered in
13 the counterparty reference data is covered by more than one description in Table 2
14 or 3, the most onerous reporting requirement across the descriptions applies in
15 relation to the counterparty for a given data attribute.
16 The most onerous requirement is understood as follows: if a counterparty takes on
17 two roles (e.g. acts as both creditor and servicer) and the same data attribute is
18 required for the one role but not required for the other, the most onerous requirement
19 implies that the data attribute is required for the counterparty.
20 Example 48 illustrates how to determine whether a data attribute is reported to
21 AnaCredit in the event that a counterparty takes on more than one role listed in the
22 headers of Table 2 (and Table 3) in Annex III to the AnaCredit Regulation.
Example 48: Most onerous requirement takes precedence
Assumptions:
• In relation to the reporting reference date 31 March 2019 the instrument INS_1 of
the observed agent RA_1_OA_1 is reported to AnaCredit by the reporting agent
RA_1. The counterparty Ctpy_A is a debtor of the instrument INS_1. The
instrument originates after 1 September 2018.
• In relation to the same reporting reference date, the reporting agent RA_1 reports
to AnaCredit the instrument INS_2 of the observed agent RA_1_OA_1. The
counterparty Ctpy_A is a protection provider for the instrument.
• The counterparty Ctpy_A is resident in a reporting Member State. The counterparty
is a legal entity. The reporting agent RA_1 reports no other instruments in which
the counterparty Ctpy_A is involved and the counterparty is not affiliated with any
other debtor or protection provider reported by the reporting agent RA_1.
Which data attributes are required for the counterparty Ctpy_A in the counterparty
reference data?
In relation to the data reported by the reporting agent RA_1, the counterparty Ctpy_A
takes on only two roles:
• debtor — at least one instrument originated on or after 1 September 2018;
• protection provider.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 146
31 May 2019
However, the counterparty only is registered in the counterparty reference data once.
The counterparty is uniquely identified by its counterparty identifier and the data
attributes to be registered are determined as follows:
In accordance with Table 2 (counterparty resident in a resident Member State), the
economic activity is required for the debtor’s role but may not be required for the
protection provider’s role depending on the decision of the relevant NCB. Since the
most onerous requirement takes precedence, the economic activity is required for the
counterparty Ctpy_A regardless of the NCB’s decision regarding the requirement for
protection providers.
Repeating the reasoning for all data attributes, the counterparty reference data reported
by the reporting agent RA_1 in relation to the counterparty Ctpy_A ultimately contains at
least the following data attributes:
• counterparty identifier (always required);
• national identifier;
• head office undertaking identifier;
• immediate parent undertaking identifier;
• ultimate parent undertaking identifier;
• name;
• address: street;
• address: city/town/village;
• address: county/administrative division;
• address: postal code;
• address: country;
• legal form;
• institutional sector;
• economic activity;
• status of legal proceedings;
• date of initiation of legal proceedings;
• enterprise size;
• date of enterprise size;
• number of employees;
• balance sheet total;
• annual turnover;
These data attributes are generally required in relation to the counterparty Ctpy_A
because they are required by the AnaCredit Regulation for debtors with at least one
instrument originated at or after 1 September 2018 (and thus required) or are required
for both debtors and protection providers.
The only data attribute that is not required in relation to the counterparty is the
accounting standard, as this attribute is only required for reporting agents and the
counterparty in question is not the reporting agent reporting the instrument.
With regard to the legal entity identifier (LEI), this data attribute may not be required for
the counterparty concerned depending on what the relevant NCB decides.

3 counterparties should be verified on relation to instruments reported to AnaCredit. Therefore, should a counterparty take
a regular basis
4 on an additional role from one reporting reference date to the next, the counterparty
5 reference data are updated accordingly. This is illustrated in the example below.
Example 49: More stringent requirements on subsequent reporting reference dates
The counterparty Ctpy_B is a servicer of an instrument of the observed agent
RA_1_OA_1 reported by the reporting agent RA_1 as of a given reporting reference
date. The counterparty Ctpy_B does not take on any other role in relation to any
instruments reported by the reporting agent RA_1.
The set of attributes to be reported in relation to the counterparty Ctpy_B is that which is
required for servicers resident in a reporting Member State as set out in Table 2
(column 11) of Annex III of the AnaCredit Regulation.
However, if on a subsequent reporting reference date the reporting agent reports an
additional instrument of which the counterparty Ctpy_B is a debtor, then the reporting
agent updates the counterparty reference data accordingly to account for the fact that
the counterparty Ctpy_B takes on two roles (servicer and debtor) as of the subsequent
reporting reference date. Again, the most onerous requirement across these roles takes
precedence (in this case, it is the role of debtor).
6 By contrast, in the opposite case where fewer data attributes are required for a
7 counterparty from one period to the next it is not necessary to update the
8 counterparty reference data by removing data attributes that are no longer strictly
9 required, provided such data remains up to date.
7.4 Deriving reduced requirements for credit data – the least
onerous requirement
10 The reporting requirements in relation to data other than counterparty reference data
11 – i.e. datasets 2 to 10 in Annex I – may be reduced if specific conditions apply.
12 AnaCredit Regulation specifies four cases in which certain data attributes are not
13 required:
14 1. observed agents that are not resident in a reporting Member State;
15 2. observed agents not subject to capital requirements;
16 3. fully derecognised instruments being serviced;
17 4. instruments originating prior to 1 September 2018.
18 The specific requirements in each of these cases are set out in Table 1 of Annex II.
19 As with the specific requirements for counterparty reference data, the following
20 classification is used:
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 148
31 May 2019
(a) N: subject to individual arrangements, the relevant NCBs may decide not
to collect this information from individual (or groups of) reporting agents;
(b) X: information not required to be reported.
1 The least onerous requirement Where no classification is provided, the information is required to be reported. Any
applies. The level of application is
2 AnaCredit data attribute that is not listed in Table 1 of Annex II is required,
the single observed agent (as
3 opposed to reporting agent) regardless of the four conditions referred to at the top of the table. However, where
4 data is covered by more than one description in Table 1, the least onerous reporting
5 requirement applies.
6 The least onerous requirement is understood as follows: if one (or more) of the four
7 cases applies in relation to the same data attribute and the data attribute is not
8 required in any of the applicable cases, the least onerous requirement implies that
9 the data attribute is not required.
10 Moreover, insofar as the requirements for counterparty reference data apply at
11 reporting agent level, the reduced requirements for the remaining data apply at the
12 level of the single observed agent.
13 To determine whether or not a certain data attribute listed in Table 1 of Annex II is
14 required, it is necessary to determine whether any of the four conditions referred to
15 at the top of the table are fulfilled for the data attribute in question. These conditions
16 apply at the relevant level: instrument, protection or counterparty. For the original
17 protection value and the date of original protection value, the relevant level is the
18 protection. For the probability of default, the default status of the counterparty and
19 the date of the default status of the counterparty, the relevant level is the
20 counterparty. For any other data attribute listed in Table 1, the relevant level is the
21 instrument.
22 It is sufficient to verify conditions 1 With regard to conditions 1 and 2, if an observed agent is (1) not resident in a
and 2 at observed agent level
23 reporting Member State or (2) not subject to capital requirements the conditions are
24 automatically fulfilled at all three levels, i.e. all instruments, counterparties and
25 protection items of that observed agent fulfil the conditions.
26 Conditions 3 and 4 are verified at instrument level. Moreover, for most of the data
27 attributes listed in Table 1 of Annex II of the AnaCredit Regulation it is sufficient to
28 verify the conditions vis-à-vis a single instrument, independently of other
29 instruments.
30 To verify conditions 3 and 4 at the For two data attributes (original protection value and date of original protection
level of the protection item, all
31 value), however, the conditions are verified at the level of the protection item,
instruments secured by the
32 protection item should be considering all instruments linked to the protection item concerned. More specifically,

33 conditions 3 and 4 are fulfilled for a given protection item if the conditions are fulfilled
34 for all instruments which the protection item secures.
35 To verify conditions 3 and 4 at the For three other data attributes (probability of default, default status of the
level of the counterparty, all
36 counterparty, and date of the default status of the counterparty), all instruments
instruments of which the
37 counterparty is a debtor should be related to a certain counterparty are considered. More specifically, conditions 3 and

31 May 2019
1 of which the counterparty is the debtor or the protection provider (please note that
2 the three data attributes are only required for counterparties who act as debtors or
3 protection providers).
4 Least onerous requirement Ultimately, if any of the four conditions is fulfilled at the respective level and there is
5 an “N” or “X” in Table 1 of Annex II for the data attribute, then the data attribute is not
6 required to be reported provided that the relevant NCB considers that this data
7 attribute is not required under this condition.
8 Example 50 illustrates the derivation of the reduced reporting requirements in
9 relation to non-counterparty reference data, where the least onerous requirement
10 applies.
Example 50: Determining the least onerous requirement
Data of the observed agent RA_1_OA_1 are reported by the reporting agent RA_1. The
observed agent RA_1_OA_1 is neither resident in a reporting Member State nor is
subject to capital requirements under the CRR.
The observed agent holds the instrument INST_1, which originated before 1 September
2018. The instrument is recognised and is secured by the protection item
PROT_1_INST_1. Please note that no additional instrument of the observed agent that
originated on or after 1 September 2018 is secured by the same protection item
PROT_1_INST_1. The counterparty Cpty_D is the debtor of the instrument.
In accordance with Table 1 of Annex II of the AnaCredit Regulation, the corresponding
reporting requirements are summarised below. The conditions to be verified are 1, 2 and
4. Specifically, the data attributes highlighted in orange in the last column (least onerous
requirement) are required unless the relevant NCB considers that they are not required
to be reported. The data attribute “prudential portfolio” is not required. All other data
attributes, including those not listed in the table, are required to be reported to
AnaCredit.
Please note that in Table 4 below, the data attributes that are subject to reduced
requirements depending on the applicability of the four cases have been highlighted in
different colours:
• data attributes that may be exempted from reporting at NCBs’ discretion are
highlighted in orange;
• data attributes that are not required are highlighted in green.
In addition, grey denotes those cases which are not applicable in the given situation,
while all other cells (in white) indicate that no special treatment applies.

1 While the explanation above focuses on the determining which data attributes are
2 actually subject to reduced reporting requirements in a given situation, the following
3 sections discuss the specific cases referred to in Annex II of the AnaCredit
4 Regulation.
7.4.1 Observed agents that are not resident in a reporting Member State
5 With regard to Case 1 as referred to in Annex II of the AnaCredit Regulation, in
6 accordance with Article 6(2) data of observed agents both resident and non-resident
7 in a reporting Member State are generally subject to AnaCredit reporting. This
8 means that reporting agents which comprise several institutional units (the domestic
9 part and any foreign branches) are responsible for reporting data relating to all these
10 institutional units.
11 Pursuant to Article 6(4), the However, the AnaCredit Regulation provides that the relevant NCB may either
relevant NCB may decide not to
12 (a) not collect any data of non-resident observed agents at all, pursuant to
collect information with regard to
13 non-resident foreign branches Article 6(4), or (b) limit the scope of the collection from non-resident observed agents
14 by not collecting data attributes marked as “N” in Table 1 of Annex II under Case 1,
15 pursuant to Article 7.
16 In both cases, non-resident observed agents are those institutional units of reporting
17 agents which are not located in a reporting Member State. These can only be foreign
18 branches located in a country which is not a reporting Member State.
19 In line with Article 1(1), and as explained in Chapter 2, a reporting Member State
20 means either:
21 • a European Union Member State whose currency is the euro;
22 • a Member State of the European Union whose currency is not the euro that
23 joins AnaCredit on a voluntary basis.
24 Consequently, all observed agents which are not located in a reporting Member
25 State are considered to be non-resident observed agents.
26 Conversely, no observed agent for which the data attribute “address: country” in the
27 counterparty reference data is reported as a reporting Member State fulfils the
28 condition “observed agents that are not resident in a reporting Member State”.
7.4.2 Observed agents not subject to capital requirements
29 Under Case 2, instruments may be subject to less stringent requirements provided
30 that the observed agent whose activity as creditor or servicer is reported:
(a) is not (a legally dependent part of) a credit institution subject to the CRR;
(b) is a foreign branch of a credit institution not subject to the CRR.
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 152
31 May 2019
1 As explained above, the applicability of this condition can be sufficiently verified at
2 the level of the observed agent without considering individual instruments.
3 The CRR only applies to credit institutions; no foreign branches of credit institutions
4 are covered by this Regulation. Please note that foreign branches (or any branch
5 offices in general) are not directly subject to the CRR or to the CRD IV because a
6 (foreign) branch is a legally dependent part of a legal entity and thus may not be
7 addressed by the CRR directly. Please note also that if a credit institution does not
8 have any foreign branches, its (only) observed agent (i.e., the domestic part) is the
9 credit institution itself.
10 Effectively, given the reporting population and the reference population as defined in
11 the AnaCredit Regulation, all observed agents are legally dependent parts of credit
12 institutions and the only applications of Case 2 are thus (a) in the case of a foreign
13 branch resident in a reporting Member State of a credit institution that is resident
14 outside the European Union and (b) in the case of credit institutions (as defined in
15 the CRR) which are exempt from supervision under Article 2(5) of the CRD IV.
7.4.3 Fully derecognised instruments being serviced
16 With regard to Case 3 referred to in Annex II of the AnaCredit Regulation, it should
17 be clarified that the scope of fully derecognised instruments being serviced
18 corresponds to instruments serviced but not held by the observed agent for which
19 the data attribute “balance sheet recognition” takes the value “entirely derecognised”.
20 Revision mark: this section is In particular, fiduciary loans which are not treated as assets by a trustee which is the
expanded with examples of
21 observed agent, as well as intracompany loans and fully transferred instruments (for
instruments that meet the definition
22 of fully derecognised instruments example being subject to traditional securitisations or other transfers), are always
being serviced and of instruments
23 treated as “fully derecognised loans being serviced” in accordance with Annex II of
that do not meet this definition
24 the AnaCredit Regulation (cf. Section 5.4.2 in Part II of the Manual).
25 However, fully written-off loans which are held by the observed agent and are not
26 recognised in the balance sheet (i.e. the data attribute “balance sheet recognition” is
27 reported as “entirely derecognised”) do not meet the definition of “fully derecognised
28 instruments being serviced” in accordance with Annex II of the AnaCredit Regulation
29 (cf. Section 5.2.2.2 for more information concerning written-off instruments).
30 In other words, “fully derecognised instruments being serviced” and “entirely
31 derecognised instruments” are related but not fully overlapping terms. Please refer to
32 Section 5.4.2 in Part II of the Manual for more details regarding the difference
33 between the two terms.
34 Conversely, no instrument, which is serviced but not held by the observed agent, for
35 which the data attribute “balance sheet recognition” is reported as “entirely
36 recognised” or “recognised to the extent of the institution’s continuing involvement”
37 meets the condition “fully derecognised instruments being serviced”. In particular,
38 fiduciary instruments which are assets of the observed agent under the relevant
39 accounting standard or instruments which are transferred but not derecognised do
AnaCredit Reporting Manual – Part I – General methodology 153
31 May 2019
1 not meet the condition “fully derecognised instruments being serviced” as referred to
2 in Annex II of the AnaCredit Regulation.
7.4.4 Instruments originating prior to 1 September 2018
3 An instrument qualifies as an instrument originating prior to 1 September 2018 if the
4 inception date reported for the instrument in the data attribute “inception date” is
5 before 1 September 2018. Conversely, instruments for which the inception date
6 reported to AnaCredit is on or after 1 September 2018 do not meet the condition
7 “instruments originating prior to 1 September 2018”.
8 Contract changes do not lead to a The application of the condition relies by and large on the inception date of an
change in the inception date
9 instrument (cf. Section 3.4.4 in Part II of the Manual). It should be made clear,
10 therefore, that a modification in the conditions of an (existing) instrument triggers a
11 renegotiation (or forbearance); the inception date of the instrument is not changed. In
12 other words, unless the old contract is cancelled and a new one issued instead,
13 contract changes do not lead to a change in the inception date – changes in the
14 contract are flagged in the respective data attributes and the date of their occurrence
15 is captured by the data attribute “date of status of forbearance and renegotiation”.
16 Identification of renegotiated and Please note that AnaCredit distinguishes between renegotiation and forbearance. In
forborne instruments is flagged via
17 both cases there is an agreement between the creditor and the debtor to amend
the data attribute “status of
18 forbearance and renegotiation” terms and conditions of the original contract, but renegotiation refers only to changes
19 under normal market conditions.
20 A renegotiation is triggered whenever the financial conditions of the instrument are
21 contractually changed. A change qualifies as a contractual change in financial
22 conditions whenever the parties involved agree, in legally binding terms, that the
23 payments and risks born in relation to the instrument change (cf. Section 5.4.12 in
24 Part II of the Manual, which deals specifically with the status of forbearance and
25 renegotiation).
26 Consequently, extending the legal final maturity date of an instrument triggers a
27 renegotiation (or forbearance) but does not trigger a change in the instrument’s
28 inception date.
29 The inception date for unauthorised The inception date for an unauthorised overdraft (i.e. a debit balance on a current
overdrafts existing as of a reporting
30 account with no credit limit) is the date on which the overdraft arose (the latest such
reference date is the date on which
31 the overdraft arose, not the date). In other words, for unauthorised overdrafts the inception date is the settlement

8 Derogations and reduced reporting
frequency for small reporting agents
1 Reporting agents are in principle subject to the full reporting requirements set out in
2 the Annex I of the AnaCredit Regulation, which specify the minimum requirements
3 that reporting agents should meet to satisfy the ECB’s reporting requirements for
4 AnaCredit.
5 However, to ensure the proportionality of the reporting obligations established in the
6 AnaCredit Regulation, there is scope for NCBs to exempt – or partially exempt –
7 certain reporting agents from these obligations.
8 In particular, the AnaCredit Regulation distinguishes between (i) small reporting
9 agents to whom derogations may be applicable pursuant to Article 16(1) and (ii)
10 small reporting agents that may temporarily report on a quarterly basis pursuant to
11 Article 16(2).
12 In the case of small reporting agents subject to derogations, the relevant NCB will
13 determine (a) the reporting agents to which derogations apply and (b) the
14 requirements that the reporting agents should meet to satisfy the ECB’s reporting
15 requirements for AnaCredit.
16 With regard to small reporting agents exempt from the monthly reporting, the
17 relevant NCB will determine which reporting agents are allowed to report on a
18 quarterly instead of a monthly basis for a fixed period of time until 1 January 2021.

24 requirements in accordance with Article 6(1). These reporting agents may

8.1 Small reporting agents subject to derogations

29 discretion, be entirely or partially exempted from the reporting obligations.

1 In line with the principle of proportionality, the AnaCredit Regulation allows NCBs to
2 grant derogations to avoid imposing an undue reporting burden, particularly on small
3 reporting agents with limited total credit exposure.
4 For each reporting Member State, there is scope within the AnaCredit Regulation to
5 grant such derogations to a subset of reporting agents provided that the total amount
6 of loans reported pursuant to the BSI Regulation by such reporting agents does not
7 exceed 2% of the overall amount of loans reported pursuant to the BSI Regulation in
8 a given reporting Member State.

22 does not account for more than 2% of the overall amount of loans reported in a given
23 reporting Member State. Not requiring data which adheres closely to the scope of
24 AnaCredit makes the process simpler and more transparent, and most importantly
25 means that reporting agents potentially subject to derogations do not have to
26 prepare relevant data as if they had to report to AnaCredit.
27 The scope of derogations is left to The relevant NCB may exempt small reporting agents entirely from the obligation to

32 are (if any).
33 Furthermore, reporting agents that no longer fulfil the conditions for receiving a
34 derogation will be informed by the relevant NCB about their reporting obligations at
35 least 18 months before the first reporting reference date for which they report data.
8.2 Small reporting agents reporting on a quarterly basis

25 the two possible types of derogations since quarterly derogations may be granted to

A reporting agent is exempted by the relevant NCB from reporting on a monthly basis.
This example concerns the instrument dataset.
On 3 January 2019 a new instrument is issued by a resident observed agent whose
data is reported by the reporting agent. The instrument exists as of the end of January,
February and March, and also thereafter.
In line with the exemption from reporting data on a monthly basis, the instrument need
not be reported as of 31 January and 28 February, so the reporting agent is obliged to
report the instrument for the first time as of the end of March. The timeline for reporting
the instrument to AnaCredit is within 30 working days after 31 March 2019.

Data: A conceptual data model is a representation of the data
conceptual data structures that are required by a database, focusing on which
model data will be stored and how they are organised. Conceptual
data models provide information for both the end-users of the
information and the developers of the database, because they
allow the structure and requirements of a database to be known

Data: An entity table is any of the distinct parts into which the data
entity table attributes to be reported to a database are grouped on the
basis of their nature. An entity table is divided in two or more
datasets when its data attributes are reported at different
frequencies or using different methodologies.
[Part I, Section 6.2 of the AnaCredit Reporting Manual]
Data: A foreign key is the combination of one or more identifiers in an
foreign key entity table that uniquely identifies a row of another entity table.
[Part I, Section 6.2.2.1 of the AnaCredit Reporting Manual]
Data: An identifier is an identifying data attribute that, alone or in
identifier combination with other identifiers, ensures that each record or
entry can be (uniquely) identified in an entity table. Identifiers
help to maintain data integrity and to identify relationships
between datasets.
[Part I, Section 6.2.2.1 of the AnaCredit Reporting Manual]
Data: A logical data model adds detail to a conceptual data model:
logical data
(a) including all necessary entity tables and
model
relationships between them;
(b) specifying the data attributes of each entity table;
(c) specifying a primary key for each entity table; and
(d) specifying the foreign keys necessary to identify the
relationship between different entity tables.
The logical data model also involves normalisation, which is the
process of removing redundancy in an entity table.
Normalisation typically occurs by dividing an entity table into
two or more parts and defining relationships between them. The
purpose of this is to replace many-to-many relationships in the
conceptual model with one-to-many relationships, which is
achieved by introducing bridging tables.
